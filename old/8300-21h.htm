<p>THE BOOK OF PSALMS</p>

<p>The psalms are called by the Hebrews TEHILLIM, that is, Hymns of Praise.
The author, of a great part of them at least, was king David: but many
are of opinion that some of them were made by Asaph, and others whose
names are prefixed in the titles.</p>

<p>
Psalms Chapter 1</p>

<p>Beatus vir.</p>

<p>The happiness of the just and the evil state of the wicked.</p>

<p>1:1. Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the
ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the chair of
pestilence:</p>

<p>1:2. But his will is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he shall
meditate day and night.</p>

<p>1:3. And he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running
waters, which shall bring forth its fruit, in due season. And his leaf
shall not fall off: and all whatsoever he shall do shall prosper.</p>

<p>1:4. Not so the wicked, not so: but like the dust, which the wind
driveth from the face of the earth.</p>

<p>1:5. Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: nor sinners
in the council of the just.</p>

<p>1:6. For the Lord knoweth the way of the just: and the way of the wicked
shall perish.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 2</p>

<p>Quare fremuerunt.</p>

<p>The vain efforts of persecutors against Christ and his church.</p>

<p>2:1. Why have the Gentiles raged, and the prople devised vain things?</p>

<p>2:2. The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together,
against the Lord, and against his Christ.</p>

<p>2:3. Let us break their bonds asunder: and let us cast away their yoke
from us.</p>

<p>2:4. He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: and the Lord shall
deride them.</p>

<p>2:5. Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his
rage.</p>

<p>2:6. But I am appointed king by him over Sion, his holy mountain,
preahing his comandment.</p>

<p>2:7. The Lord hath said to me: Thou art my son, this day have I begotten
thee.</p>

<p>2:8. Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance,
and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.</p>

<p>2:9. Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, and shalt break them in
pieces like a potter's vessel.</p>

<p>2:10. And now, O ye kings, understand: receive instruction, you that
judge the earth.</p>

<p>2:11. Serve ye the Lord with fear: and rejoice unto him with trembling.</p>

<p>2:12. Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and you
perish from the just way.</p>

<p>2:13. When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time, blessed are all
they that trust in him.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 3</p>

<p>Domine, quid multiplicati.</p>

<p>The prophet's danger and delivery from his son Absalom: mystically, the
passion and resurrection of Christ.</p>

<p>3:1. The psalm of David when he fled from the face of his son Absalom.</p>

<p>3:2. Many say to my soul: There is no salavation for him in his God.</p>

<p>3:4. But thou, O Lord, art my protector, my glory, and the lifter up of
my head.</p>

<p>3:5. I have cried to the Lord with my voice: and he hath heard me from
his holy hill.</p>

<p>3:6. I have slept and have taken my rest: and I have risen up, because
the Lord hath protected me.</p>

<p>3:7. I will not fear thousands of the people surrounding me: arise, O
Lord; save me, O my God.</p>

<p>3:8. For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without cause:
thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.</p>

<p>3:9. Salvation is of the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 4</p>

<p>Cum invocarem.</p>

<p>The prophet teacheth us to flee to God in tribulation, with confidence
in him.</p>

<p>4:1. Unto the end, in verses. A psalm for David.</p>

<p>Unto the end... Or, as St. Jerome renders it, victori, to him that
overcometh: which some understand of the chief musician; to whom they
suppose the psalms, which bear that title, were given to be sung: we
rather understand the psalms thus inscribed to refer to Christ, who is
the end of the law, and the great conqueror of death and hell, and to
the New Testament.-Ibid. In verses, in carminibus... In the Hebrew, it
is neghinoth, supposed by some to be a musical instrument, with which
this psalm was to be sung.-Ibid. For David, or to David... That is,
inspired to David himself, or to be sung.</p>

<p>4:2. When I called upon him, the God of my justice heard me: when I was
in distress, thou hast enlarged me. Have mercy on me: and hear my
prayer.</p>

<p>4:3. O ye sons of men, how long will you be dull of heart? why do you
love vanity, and seek after lying?</p>

<p>4:4. Know ye also that the Lord hath made his holy one wonderful: the
Lord will hear me when I shall cry unto him.</p>

<p>4:5. Be ye angry, and sin not: the things you say in your hearts, be
sorry for them upon your beds.</p>

<p>4:6. Offer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord: many say,
Who sheweth us good things?</p>

<p>4:7. The light of thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us: thou hast
given gladness in my heart.</p>

<p>4:8. By the fruit of their corn, their wine, and oil, they rest:</p>

<p>4:9. In peace in the self same I will sleep, and I will rest:</p>

<p>4:10. For thou, O Lord, singularly hast settled me in hope.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 5</p>

<p>Verba mea auribul.</p>

<p>A prayer to God against the iniquities of men.</p>

<p>5:1. Unto the end, for her that obtaineth the inheritance. A psalm for
David.</p>

<p>For her that obtaineth the inheritance... That is, for the church of
Christ.</p>

<p>5:2. Give ear, O Lord, to my words, understand my cry.</p>

<p>5:3. Hearken to the voice of my prayer, O my King and my God.</p>

<p>5:4. For to thee will I pray: O Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear my
voice.</p>

<p>5:5. In the morning I will stand before thee, and I will see: because
thou art not a God that willest iniquity.</p>

<p>5:6. Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee: nor shall the unjust
abide before thy eyes.</p>

<p>5:7. Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity: thou wilt destroy all that
speak a lie. The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor.</p>

<p>5:8. But as for me in the multitude of thy mercy, I will come into thy
house; I will worship towards thy holy temple, in thy fear.</p>

<p>5:9. Conduct me, O Lord, in thy justice: because of my enemies, direct
my way in thy sight.</p>

<p>5:10. For there is no truth in their mouth: their heart is vain.</p>

<p>5:11. Their throat is an open sepulchre: they dealt deceitfully with
their tongues: judge them, O God. Let them fall from their devices:
according to the multitude of their wickednesses cast them out: for they
have provoked thee, O Lord.</p>

<p>5:12. But let all them be glad that hope in thee: they shall rejoice for
ever, and thou shalt dwell in them. And all they that love thy name
shall glory in thee.</p>

<p>5:13. For thou wilt bless the just. O Lord, thou hast crowned us, as
with a shield of thy good will.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 6</p>

<p>Domine, ne in furore.</p>

<p>A prayer of a penitent sinner, under the scourge of God. The first
penitential psalm.</p>

<p>6:1. Unto the end, in verses, a psalm for David, for the octave.</p>

<p>For the octave... That is, to be sung on an instrument of eight strings.
St. Augustine understands it mystically, of the last resurrection, and
the world to come; which is, as it were, the octave, or eighth day,
after the seven days of this mortal life: and for this octave, sinners
must dispose themselves, like David, by bewailing their sins, whilst
they are here upon earth.</p>

<p>6:2. O Lord, rebuke me not in thy indignation, nor chastise me in thy
wrath.</p>

<p>6:3. Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak: heal me, O Lord, for my
bones are troubled.</p>

<p>6:4. And my soul is troubled exceedingly: but thou, O Lord, how long?</p>

<p>6:5. Turn to me, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy's
sake.</p>

<p>5:5. For there is no one indeath, that is mindful of thee: and who shall
confess to thee in hell?</p>

<p>6:7. I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed: I
will water my couch with my tears.</p>

<p>6:8. My eye is troubled through indignation: I have grown old amongst
all my enemies.</p>

<p>6:9. Depart from em, all ye workers of iniquity: for the Lord hath heard
the voice of my weeping.</p>

<p>6:10. The Lord hath heard my supplication: the Lord hath received my
prayer.</p>

<p>6:11. Let all my enemies be ashamed, and be very much troubled: let them
be turned back, and be ashamed very speedily.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 7</p>

<p>Domine, Deus meus.</p>

<p>David, trusting in the justice of his cause, prayeth for God's help
against his enemies.</p>

<p>7:1. The psalm of David, which he sung to the Lord, for the words of
Chusi, the son of Jemini.</p>

<p>7:2. O Lord, my God, in thee have I put my trust; same me from all them
that persecute me, and deliver me.</p>

<p>7:3. Lest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion, while there is
no one to redeem me, nor to save.</p>

<p>7:4. O Lord, my God, if I have done this thing, if there be iniquity in
my hands:</p>

<p>7:5. If I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, let me deservedly
fall empty before my enemies.</p>

<p>7:6. Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life,
on the earth, and bring down my glory to the dust.</p>

<p>7:7. Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger: and be thou exalted in the borders
of my enemies. And arise, O Lord, my God, in the precept which thou hast
commanded:</p>

<p>7:8. And a congregation of people shall surround thee. And for their
sakes return thou on high.</p>

<p>7:9. The Lord judgeth the people. Judge me, O Lord, according to my
justice, and according to my innocence in me.</p>

<p>7:10. The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought; and thou
shalt direct the just: the searcher of hearts and reins is God.</p>

<p>7:11. Just is my help from the Lord; who saveth the upright of heart.</p>

<p>7:12. God is a just judge, strong and patient: is he angry every day?</p>

<p>7:13. Except you will be converted, he will brandish his sword; he hath
bent his bow, and made it ready.</p>

<p>7:14. And in it he hath prepared to instruments of death, he hath made
ready his arrows for them that burn.</p>

<p>For them that burn... That is, against the persecutors of his saints.</p>

<p>7:15. Behold he hath been in labour iwht injustice: he hath conceived
sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.</p>

<p>7:16. He hath opened a pit and dug it: and he is fallen into the hole he
made.</p>

<p>7:17. His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: and his iniquity shall
come down upon his crown.</p>

<p>7:18. I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice: and will
sing to the name of the Lord the most high.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 8</p>

<p>Domine, Dominus noster.</p>

<p>God is wonderful in his works; especially in mankind, singularly exalted
by the incarnation of Christ.</p>

<p>8:1. Unto the end, for the presses: a psalm for David.</p>

<p>The presses... In Hebrew, Gittith, supposed to be a musical instrument.</p>

<p>8:2. O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is thy name in the whole earth! For
thy magnificence is elevated above the heavens.</p>

<p>8:3. Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected
praise, because of thy enemies, that thou mayst destroy the enemy and
the avenger.</p>

<p>8:4. For I will behold thy heavens, the works of thy fingers: the moon
and the stars which thou hast founded.</p>

<p>8:5. What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that
thou visitest him?</p>

<p>8:6. Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned
him with glory and honour:</p>

<p>8:7. And hast set him over the works of thy hands.</p>

<p>8:8. Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen:
moreover, the beasts also of the fields.</p>

<p>8:9. The birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, that pass through
the paths of the sea.</p>

<p>8:10. O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is thy name in the whole earth!</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 9</p>

<p>Confitebor tibi, Domine. The church praiseth God for his protection
against her enemies.</p>

<p>9:1. Unto the end, for the hidden things of the Son. A psalm for David.</p>

<p>The hidden things of the Son... The humility and sufferings of Christ,
the Son of God; and of good Christians, who are his sons by adoption;
are called hidden things, with regard to the children of this world, who
know not the value and merit of them.</p>

<p>9:2. I will give lpraise to thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will
relate all thy wonders.</p>

<p>9:3. I will be glad, and rejoice inthee: I will sing to thy name, O thou
most high.</p>

<p>9:4. When my enemy shall be turned back: they shall be weakened, and
perish before thy face.</p>

<p>9:5. For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: thou hast sat on
the throne, who judgest justice.</p>

<p>9:6. Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the wicked one hath perished;
thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.</p>

<p>9:7. The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and their cities
thou hast destroyed. Their memory hath perished with a noise:</p>

<p>9:8. But the Lord remaineth for ever. He hath prepared his throne in
judgment:</p>

<p>9:9. And he shall judge the world in equity, he shall judge the lpeople
in justice.</p>

<p>9:10. And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor: a helper in due time
in tribulation.</p>

<p>9:11. And let them trust in thee who know thy name: for thou hast not
forsaken them that seek thee, O Lord.</p>

<p>9:12. Sing ye to the Lord, who dwelleth in Sion: declare his ways among
the Gentiles:</p>

<p>9:13. For requiring their blood, he hath remembered them: he hath not
forgotten the cry of the poor.</p>

<p>9:14. Have mercy on me, O Lord: see my humiliation which I suffer from
my enemies.</p>

<p>9:15. Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death, that I may
declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.</p>

<p>9:16. I will rejoice in thy salvation: the Gentiles have stuck fast in
the destruction which they prepared. Their foot hath been taken in the
very snare which they hid.</p>

<p>9:17. The Lord shall be known when he executeth judgments: the sinner
hath been caught in the works of his own hands.</p>

<p>9:18. The wicked shall be turned into hell, all the nations that forget
God.</p>

<p>9:19. For the poor man shall not be forgotten to the end: the patience
of the poor shall not perish for ever.</p>

<p>9:20. Arise, O Lord, let not man be strengthened: let the Gentiles be
judged in thy sight.</p>

<p>9:21. Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: that the Gentiles may know
themselves to be but men.</p>

<p>Here the late Hebrew doctors divide this psalm into two, making ver. 22
the beginning of psalm 10. And again they join Psalms 146 and 147 into
one, in order that the whole number of psalms should not exceed 150. And
in this manner the psalms are numbered in the Protestant Bible.</p>

<p>(Psalm Chapter 10 according to the Hebrews.)</p>

<p>9:1. Why, O Lord, hast thou retired afar off? why dost thou slight us in
our wants, in the time of trouble?</p>

<p>9:2. Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: they are
caught in the counsels which they devise.</p>

<p>9:3. For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: and the
unjust man is blessed.</p>

<p>9:4. The sinner hath provoked the Lord, according to the multitude of
his wrath, he will not seek him:</p>

<p>9:5. God is not before his eyes: his ways are filthy at all times. Thy
judgments are removed form his sight: he shall rule over all his
enemies.</p>

<p>9:6. For he hath said in his heart: I shall not be moved from generation
to generation, and shall be without evil.</p>

<p>9:7. His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deciet:
under his tongue are labour and sorrow.</p>

<p>9:8. He sitteth in ambush with the rich, in private places, that he may
kill the innocent.</p>

<p>9:9. His eyes are upon the poor man: he lieth in wait, in secret, like a
lion in his den. He lieth in ambush, that he may catch the poor man: so
catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him.</p>

<p>9:10. In his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and fall, when
he shall have power over the poor.</p>

<p>9:11. For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he hath turned
away his face, not to see to the end.</p>

<p>9:12. Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor.</p>

<p>9:13. Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said in his
heart: He will not require it.</p>

<p>9:14. Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou
mayst deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor man left: thou
wilt be a helper to the orphan.</p>

<p>9:15. Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: his sin
shall be sought, and shall not be found.</p>

<p>9:16. The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: ye
Gentiles shall perish from his land.</p>

<p>9:17. The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: thy ear hath heard the
preparatgion of their heart.</p>

<p>9:18. To judge for the fatherless and for the humble, that man may no
more presume to magnify himself upon earth.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 10</p>

<p>In Domino confido.</p>

<p>The just man's confidence in God in the midst of persecutions.</p>

<p>10:1. Unto the end. A psalm to David.</p>

<p>10:2. In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: Get
thee away from hence to the mountain, like a sparrow.</p>

<p>10:3. For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow: they have prepared their
arows in the quiver, to shoot in the dark the upright of heart.</p>

<p>10:4. For they have destroyed the things which thou hast made: but what
has the just man done?</p>

<p>10:5. The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven.
His eyes look on the poor man: his eyelids examine the sons of men.</p>

<p>10:6. The Lord trieth the just and the wicked: but he that loveth
iniquity, hateth his own soul.</p>

<p>10:7. He shall rain snares upon sinners: fire and brimstone, and storms
of winds, shall be the portion of their cup.</p>

<p>10:8. For the Lord is just, and hath loved justice: his countenance hath
beheld righteousness.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 11</p>

<p>Salvum me fac.</p>

<p>The prophet calls for God's help against the wicked.</p>

<p>11:1. Unto the end: for the octave, a psalm for David.</p>

<p>11:2. Save me, O Lord, for there is now no saint: truths are decayed
from among the children of men.</p>

<p>11:3. They have spoken vain things, every one to his neighbour: with
deceitful lips, and with a double heart have they spoken.</p>

<p>11:4. May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips, and the tongue that
speaketh proud things.</p>

<p>11:5. Who have said: We will magnify our tongue: our lips are our own:
who is Lord over us?</p>

<p>11:6. By reason of the misery of the needy, and the groans of the poor,
now will I arise, saith the Lord. I will set him in safety: I will deal
confidently in his regard.</p>

<p>11:7. The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried by the fire,
purged from the earth, refined seven times.</p>

<p>11:8. Thou, O Lord, wilt preserve us: and keep us from this generation
for ever.</p>

<p>11:9. The wicked walk round about: according to thy highness, thou hast
multiplied the children of men.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 12</p>

<p>Usquequo, Domine.</p>

<p>A prayer in tribulation.</p>

<p>12:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David. How long, O Lord, wilt thou
forget me unto the end? how long dost thou turn away thy face from me?</p>

<p>12:2. How long shall I take counsels in my soul, sorrow in my heart all
the day?</p>

<p>12:3. How long shall my enemy be exalted over Me?</p>

<p>12:4. Consider, and hear me, O Lord, my God. Enlighten my eyes, that I
never sleep in death:</p>

<p>12:5. Lest at any time my enemy say: I have prevailed against him. They
that trouble me, will rejoice when I am moved:</p>

<p>12:6. But I have trusted in thy mercy. My heart shall rejoice in thy
salvation: I will sing to the Lord, who giveth me good things: yea, I
will sing to the name of the Lord, the most high.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 13</p>

<p>Dixit insipiens. 1.</p>

<p>The general corruption of man before our redemption by Christ.</p>

<p>13:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David. The fool hath said in his heart:
There is no God. They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their
ways: there is none that doth good, no not one.</p>

<p>13:2. The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to
see if there be any that understand and seek God.</p>

<p>13:3. They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together:
there is none that doth good: no not one. Their throat is an open
sepulchre; with their tongues they acted deceitfully: the poison of asps
is under their lips. &nbsp;Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;
their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and unhappiness in their
ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God
before their eyes.</p>

<p>13:4. Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people
as they eat bread?</p>

<p>13:5. They have not called upon the Lord: there have they trembled for
fear, where there was no fear.</p>

<p>13:6. For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the
counsel of the poor man; but the Lord is his hope.</p>

<p>13:7. Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when the Lord
shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice,
and Israel shall be glad.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 14</p>

<p>Domine, quis habitabit.</p>

<p>What kind of men shall dwell in the heavenly Sion.</p>

<p>14:1. A psalm for David. Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? or who
shall rest in thy holy hill?</p>

<p>14:2. He that walketh without blemish, and worketh justice:</p>

<p>14:3. He that speaketh truth in his heart, who hath not used deceit in
his tongue: Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: nor taken up a reproach
against his neighbours.</p>

<p>14:4. In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: but he
glorifieth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his neighbour,
and deceiveth not;</p>

<p>14:5. He that hath not put out his money to usury, nortaken bribes
against the innocent: He that doth these things, chall not be moved for
ever.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 15</p>

<p>Conserva me, Domine.</p>

<p>Christ's future victory and triumph over the world and death.</p>

<p>15:1. The inscription of a title to David himself. Preserve me, O Lord,
for I have put my trust in thee.</p>

<p>The inscription of a title... That is, of a pillar or monument,
staylographia: which is as much as to say, that this psalm is most
worthy to be engraved on an everlasting monument.</p>

<p>15:2. I have said to the Lord, thou art my God, for thou hast no need of
my goods.</p>

<p>15:3. To the saints, who are in his land, he hath made wonderful all my
desires in them.</p>

<p>15:4. Their infirmities were multiplied: afterwards they made haste. I
will not gather together their meetings for bloodofferings: nor will I
be mindful of their names by my lips.</p>

<p>15:5. The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: it is
thou that wilt restore my inheritance to me.</p>

<p>15:6. The lines are fallen unto me in goodly places: for my inheritance
is goodly to me.</p>

<p>15:7. I will bless the Lord, who hath given me understanding: moreover,
my reins also have corrected me even till night.</p>

<p>15:8. I set the Lord always in my sight: for he is at my right hand,
that I be not moved.</p>

<p>15:9. Therefore my heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced:
moreover, my flesh also shall rest in hope.</p>

<p>15:10. Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; nor wilt thou give
thy holy one to see corruption.</p>

<p>15:11. Thou hast made known to me the ways of life, thou shalt fill me
with joy with thy countenance: at thy right hand are delights even to
the end.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 16</p>

<p>Exaudi, Domine, justitiam.</p>

<p>A just man's prayer in tribulation against the malice of his enemy.</p>

<p>16:1. The prayer of David. Hear, O Lord, my justice: attend to my
supplication. Give ear unto my prayer, which proceedeth not from
deceitful lips.</p>

<p>16:2. Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: let thy eyes
behold the things that are equitable.</p>

<p>16:3. Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, thou hast
tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me.</p>

<p>16:4. That my mouth may not speak the works of men: for the sake of the
words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.</p>

<p>16:5. Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps be not
moved.</p>

<p>16:6. I have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: O incline
thy ear unto me, and hear my words.</p>

<p>16:7. Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; thou who savest them that trust
in thee.</p>

<p>16:8. From them that resist thy right hand keep me, as the apple of thy
eye. Protect me under the shadow of thy wings.</p>

<p>16:9. From the face of the wicked who have afflicted me. My enemies have
surrounded my soul:</p>

<p>16:10. They have shut up their fat: their mouth hath spoken proudly.</p>

<p>Their fat... That is, their bowels of compassion: for they have none for
me.</p>

<p>16:11. They have cast me forth, and now they have surrounded me: they
have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.</p>

<p>16:12. They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; and as a
young lion dwelling in secret places.</p>

<p>16:13. Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and supplant him; deliver my soul
from the wicked one; thy sword</p>

<p>16:14. From the enemies of thy hand. O Lord, divide them from the few of
the earth in their life: their belly is filled from thy hidden stores.
They are full of children: and they have left to their little ones the
rest of their substance.</p>

<p>Divide them from the few, etc... That is, cut them off from the earth,
and the few trifling things thereof; which they are so proud of, or
divide them from the few; that is, from thy elect, who are but few; that
they may no longer have it in their power to oppress them. It is not
meant by way of a curse or imprecation; but, as many other the like
passages in the psalms, by way of a prediction, or prophecy of what
should come upon them, in punishment of their wickedness. Ibid. Thy
hidden stores... Thy secret treasures, out of which thou furnishest
those earthly goods, which, with a bountiful hand thou hast distributed
both to the good and the bad.</p>

<p>16:15. But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: I shall
be satisfied when thy glory shall appear.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 17</p>

<p>Diligam te, Domine.</p>

<p>David's thanks to God for his delivery from all his enemies.</p>

<p>17:1. Unto the end, for David, the servant of the Lord, who spoke to the
Lord the words of this canticle, in the day that the Lord delivered him
from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: and he
said:</p>

<p>17:2. I will love thee, O Lord, my strength:</p>

<p>17:3. The Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my deliverer. My God is
my helper, and in him will I put my trust. My protector, and the horn of
my salvation, and my support.</p>

<p>17:4. Praising, I will call upon the Lord: and I shall be saved from my
enemies.</p>

<p>17:5. The sorrows of death surrounded me: and the torrents of iniquity
troubled me.</p>

<p>17:6. The sorrows of hell encompassed me: and the snares of death
prevented me.</p>

<p>17:7. In my affliction I called upon the Lord, and I cried to my God:
And he heard my voice from his holy temple: and my cry before him came
into his ears.</p>

<p>17:8. The earth shook and trembled: the foundations of the mountains
were troubled and were moved, because he was angry with them.</p>

<p>17:9. There went up a smoke in his wrath: and a fire flamed from his
face: coals were kindled by it.</p>

<p>17:10. He bowed the heavens, and came down, and darkness was under his
feet.</p>

<p>17:11. And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; he flew upon the
wings of the winds.</p>

<p>17:12. And he made darkness his covert, his pavilion round about him:
dark waters in the clouds of the air.</p>

<p>17:13. At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed, hail and
coals of fire.</p>

<p>17:14. And the Lord thundered from heaven, and the Highest gave his
voice: hail and coals of fire.</p>

<p>17:15. And he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: he
multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.</p>

<p>17:16. Then the fountains of waters appeared, and the foundations of the
world were discovered: At thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the spirit
of thy wrath.</p>

<p>17:17. He sent from on high, and took me: and received me out of many
waters.</p>

<p>17:18. He delivered me from my strongest enemies, and from them that
hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>

<p>17:19. They prevented me in the day of my affliction: and the Lord
became my rotector.</p>

<p>17:20. And he brought me forth into a large place: he saved me, because
he was well pleased with me.</p>

<p>17:21. And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; and will
repay me according to the cleanness of my hands:</p>

<p>17:22. Because I have kept the ways of the Lord; and have not done
wickedly against my God.</p>

<p>17:23. For all his judgments are in my sight: and his justices I have
not put away from me.</p>

<p>17:24. And I shall be spotless with him: and shall keep myself from my
iniquity.</p>

<p>17:25. And the Lord will reward me according to my justice: and
according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.</p>

<p>17:26. With the holy thou wilt be holy; and with the innocent man thou
wilt be innocent:</p>

<p>17:27. And withe the elect thou wilt be elect: and with the perverse
thou wilt be perverted.</p>

<p>17:28. For thou wilt save the humble people; but wilt bring down the
eyes of the proud.</p>

<p>17:29. For thou lightest my lamp, O Lord: O my God, enlighten my
darkness.</p>

<p>17:30. For by thee I shall be delivered from temptation; and through my
God I shall go over a wall.</p>

<p>17:31. As for my God, his way is undefiled: the words of the Lord are
fire-tried: he is the protector of all that trust in him.</p>

<p>17:32. For who is God but the Lord? or who is God but our God?</p>

<p>17:33. God, who hath girt me with strength; and made my way blameless.</p>

<p>17:34. Who hath made my feet like the feet of harts: and who setteth me
upon high places.</p>

<p>17:35. Who teacheth my hands to war: and thou hast made my arms like a
brazen bow.</p>

<p>17:36. And thou hast given me the protection of thy salvation: and thy
right hand hath held me up: And thy discipline hath corrected me unto
the end: and thy discipline, the same shall teach me.</p>

<p>17:37. Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; and my feet are not
weakened.</p>

<p>17:38. I will pursue after my enemies, and overtake them: and I will not
turn again till they are consumed.</p>

<p>17:39. I will break them, and they shall not be able to stand: they
shall fall under my feet.</p>

<p>17:40. And thou hast girded me with strength unto battle; and hast
subdued under me them that rose up against me.</p>

<p>17:41. And thou hast made my enemies furn their back upon me, and hast
destroyed them that hated me.</p>

<p>17:42. They cried, but there was none to save them, to the Lord: but he
heard them not.</p>

<p>17:43. And I shall beat them as small as the dust before the wind; I
shall bring them to nought, like the dirt in the streets.</p>

<p>17:44. Thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions of the people; thou
wilt make me head of the Gentiles.</p>

<p>17:45. A people which I knew not, hath seerved me: at the hearing of the
ear they have obeyed me.</p>

<p>17:46. The children that are strangers have lied to me, strange children
have faded away, and have halted from their paths.</p>

<p>17:47. The Lord liveth, and blessed by my God, and let the God of my
salvation be exalted.</p>

<p>17:48. O God, who avengest me, and subduest the people under me, my
deliverer from my enraged enemies.</p>

<p>17:49. And thou wilt lift me up above them that rise up against me: from
the unjust man thou wilt deliver me.</p>

<p>17:50. Therefore will I give glory to thee, O Lord, among the nations,
and I will sing a psalm to thy name.</p>

<p>17:51. Giving great deliverance to his king, and shewing mercy to David,
his anointed: and to his seed for ever.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 18</p>

<p>Coeli enarrant.</p>

<p>The works of God shew forth his glory: his law is greatly to be esteemed
and loved.</p>

<p>18:1. Unto the end. APsalm Chapter for David.</p>

<p>18:2. The heavens shew forth the glory of God, and the firmament
declareth the work of his hands.</p>

<p>18:3. Day to day uttereth speech, and night to night sheweth knowledge.</p>

<p>18:4. There are no speeches nor languages, where their voices are not
heard.</p>

<p>18:5. Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: and their words
unto the ends of the world.</p>

<p>18:6. He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: and he as a bridegroom
coming out of his bridechamber, Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way:</p>

<p>18:7. His going out is from the end of heaven, And his circuit even to
the end thereof: and ther is no one that can hide himself from his heat.</p>

<p>18:8. The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: the testimony
of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.</p>

<p>18:9. The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: the
commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.</p>

<p>18:10. The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: the
judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.</p>

<p>18:11. More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: and
sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.</p>

<p>18:12. For thy servant keepeth them, and in keeping them there is a
great reward.</p>

<p>18:13. Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord:</p>

<p>18:14. And from those of others spare thy servant. If they shall have no
dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: and I shall be cleansed
form the greatest sin.</p>

<p>18:15. And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: and the
meditation of my heart always in thy sight. O Lord, my helper and my
Redeemer.</p>

<p>Exaudiat te Dominus.</p>

<p>A prayer for the king.</p>

<p>19:1. Unto the end. A psalm for David.</p>

<p>19:2. May the Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation: may the name of
the God of Jacob protect thee.</p>

<p>19:3. May he send thee help from the sanctuary: and defend thee outof
Sion.</p>

<p>19:4. May he be mindful of all thy sacrifices: and may thy whole
burntoffering be made fat.</p>

<p>19:5. May he give thee according to thy own heart; and confirm all thy
counsels.</p>

<p>19:6. We will rejoice in thy salvation; and in the name of our God we
shall be exalted.</p>

<p>19:7. The Lord fulfil all thy petitions: now have I known that the Lord
hath saved his anointed. He will hear him from his holy heaven: the
salvation of his right hand is in powers.</p>

<p>The salvation of his right hand is in powers... That is, in strength.
His right hand is strong and mighty to save them that trust in him.</p>

<p>19:8. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will call upon
the name of the Lord, our God.</p>

<p>19:9. They are bound, and have fallen: but we are risen, and are set
upright. O Lord, save the king: and hear us in the day that we shall
call upon thee.</p>

<p>Domine, in virtute.</p>

<p>Praise to God for Christ's exaltation after his passion.</p>

<p>20:1. Unto the end. A psalm for David.</p>

<p>20:2. In thy strength, O Lord, the king shall joy; and in thy salvation
he shall rejoice exceedingly.</p>

<p>20:3. Thou hast given him his heart's desire: and hast not withholden
from him the will of his lips.</p>

<p>20:4. For thou hast prevented him with belssings of sweetness: thou hast
set on his head a crown of precious stones.</p>

<p>20:5. He asked life of thee: and thou hast given him length of days for
ever and ever.</p>

<p>20:6. His glory is great in thy salvation: glory and great beauty shalt
thou lay upon hom.</p>

<p>20:7. For thou shalt give him to be a blessing for ever and ever: thou
shalt make him joyful in gladness with thy countenance.</p>

<p>20:8. For the king hopeth in the Lord: andthrough the mercy of the most
High he whall not be moved.</p>

<p>20:9. Let thy hand be found by all thy enemies: let thy right hand find
out all them that hate thee.</p>

<p>20:10. Thou shalt make them as an oven of fire, in the time of thy
anger: the Lord shall trouble them in his wrath, and fire shall devour
them.</p>

<p>20:11. Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth: and their seed
from among the children of men.</p>

<p>20:12. For they have intended evils against thee: they have devised
counsels which they have not been able to establish.</p>

<p>20:13. For thou shalt make them turn their back: in thy remnants thou
shalt prepare their face.</p>

<p>In thy remnants thou shalt prepare their face... Or thou shalt set thy
remnants against their faces. That is, thou shalt make them see what
punishments remain for them hereafter from thy justice. Instead of
remnants, St. Jerome renders it funes, that is, cords or strings, viz.,
of the bow of divine justice, from which God directs his arrows against
the faces of his enemies.</p>

<p>20:14. Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thy own strength: we will sing and
praise thy power.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 21</p>

<p>Deus Deus meus.</p>

<p>Christ's passion: and the conversion of the Gentiles.</p>

<p>21:1. Unto the end, for the morning protection, a psalm for David.</p>

<p>21:2. O God my God, look upon me: why hast thou forsaken me? Far from my
salvation are the words of my sins.</p>

<p>The words of my sins... That is, the sins of the world, which I have
taken upon myself, cry out against me, and are the cause of all my
sufferings.</p>

<p>21:3. O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: and by
night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.</p>

<p>21:4. But thou dwellest in the holy place, the praise of Israel.</p>

<p>21:5. In thee have our fathers hoped: they have hoped, and thou hast
delivered them.</p>

<p>21:6. They cried to thee, and they were saved: they trusted in thee, and
were not confounded.</p>

<p>21:7. Bukt I am a worm, and no man: the reproach of men, and the outcast
of the prople.</p>

<p>21:8. All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: they have spoken
with the lips, and wagged the head.</p>

<p>21:9. He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: let him save him,
seeing he delighteth in him.</p>

<p>21:10. For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: my hope from
the breasts of my mother.</p>

<p>21:11. I was cast upon thee from the womb. From my mother's womb thou
art my God,</p>

<p>21:12. Depart not from me. For tribulation is very near: for there is
none to help me.</p>

<p>21:13. Many calves have surrounded me: fat bulls have besieged me.</p>

<p>21:14. They have opened their mouths against me, as a lion ravening and
roaring.</p>

<p>21:15. I am poured out like water; and all my bones are scattered. My
heart is become like wax melting in the midast of my bowels.</p>

<p>21:16. My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath
cleaved to my jaws: and thou hast brought me down into the dust of
death.</p>

<p>21:17. For many dogs have encompassed me: the council of the malignant
hath besieged me. They have dug my hands and feet.</p>

<p>21:18. They have numbered all my bones. And they have looked and stared
upon me.</p>

<p>21:19. They lparted my garments amongst them; and upon my vesture they
cast lots.</p>

<p>21:20. But thou, O Lord, remove not thy help to a distance from me; look
towards my defence.</p>

<p>21:21. Deliver, O God, my soul from the sword: my only one from the hand
of the dog.</p>

<p>21:22. Save me from the lion's mouth; and my lowness from the horns of
the unicorns.</p>

<p>21:23. I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the
church will I praise thee.</p>

<p>21:24. Ye that fear the Lord, praise him: all ye the seed of Jacob,
glorify him.</p>

<p>21:25. Let all the seed of Israel fear him: because he hath not slighted
nor despised the supplication of the poor man. Neither hath he turned
away his face form me: and when I cried to him he heard me.</p>

<p>21:26. With thee is my praise in a great church: I will pay my vows in
the sight of them that fear him.</p>

<p>21:27. The poor shall eat and shall be filled: and they shall praise the
Lord that seek him: their hearts shall live for ever and ever.</p>

<p>21:28. All the ends of the earth shall remember, and shall be converted
to the Lord: And all the kindreds of the Gentiles shall adore in his
sight.</p>

<p>21:29. For the kingdom is the Lord's; and he shall have dominion over
the nations.</p>

<p>21:30. All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: all
they that go down to the earth shall fall before him.</p>

<p>21:31. And to him my soul shall live: and my seed shall serve him.</p>

<p>21:32. There shall be declared to the Lord a generation to come: and the
heavens shall shew forth his justice to a people that shall be born,
which the Lord hath made.</p>

<p>Dominus regit me.</p>

<p>God's spiritual benefits to faithful souls.</p>

<p>22:1. A psalm for David. The Lord ruleth me: and I shall want nothing.</p>

<p>Ruleth me... In Hebrew, Is my shepherd, viz., to feed, guide, and govern
me.</p>

<p>22:2. He hath set me in a place of pasture. He hath brought me up, on
the water of refreshment:</p>

<p>22:3. He hath converted my soul. He hath led me on the paths of justice,
for his own name's sake.</p>

<p>22:4. For though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I
will fear no evils, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they
have comforted me.</p>

<p>22:5. Thou hast prepared a table before me against them that afflict me.
Thou hast anointed my head with oil; and my chalice which inebreateth
me, how goodly is it!</p>

<p>22:6. And thy mercy will follow me all the days of my life. And that I
may dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days.</p>

Lord's and the fulness thereof: the world, and all they that dwell
therein.</p>

the rivers.</p>

<p>23:3. Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord: or who shall stand
in his holy place?</p>

<p>23:4. The innocent in hands, and clean of heart, who hath not taken his
soul in vain, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour.</p>

<p>23:5. He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his
Saviour.</p>

<p>23:6. This is the generation of them that seek him, of them that seek
the face of the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>23:7. Lift up your gates, O ye lprinces, and be ye lifted up, O eternal
gates: and the King of Glory shall enter in.</p>

<p>23:8. Who is this King of Glory? the Lord who is strong and mighty: the
Lord mighty in battle.</p>

<p>23:9. Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, O eternal
gates: and the King of Glory shall enter in.</p>

Glory.</p>

<p>A prayer for grace, mercy, and protection against our enemies.</p>

<p>24:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David. To thee, O Lord, have I lifted up
my soul.</p>

<p>24:2. In thee, O my God, I put my trust; let me not be ashamed.</p>

<p>24:3. Neither let my enemies laugh at me: for none of them that wait on
thee shall be confounded.</p>

<p>24:4. Let all them be confounded that act unjust things without cause.
Shew, O Lord, thy ways to me, and teach me thy paths.</p>

<p>24:5. Direct me in thy truth, and teach me; for thou art God my Saviour;
and on thee have I waited all the day long.</p>

<p>24:6. Remember, O Lor, thy bowels of compassion; and thy mercies that
are from the beginning of the world.</p>

<p>24:7. The sins of my youth and my ignorances do not remember. According
to thy mercy remember thou me: for thy goodness' sake, O Lord.</p>

sinners in the way.</p>

great.</p>

shall be made manifest to them.</p>

of the snare.</p>

necessities.</p>

with an unjust hatred.</p>

have hoped in thee.</p>

<p>24:21. The innocent and the upright have adhered to me: because I have
waited on thee.</p>

<p>24:22. Deliver Israel, O God, from all his tribulations.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 25</p>

<p>Judica me, Domine.</p>

<p>David's prayer to God in his distress, to be delivered, that he may come
to worship him in his tabernacle.</p>

<p>25:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David. Judge me, O Lord, for I have
walked in my innocence: and I have put my trust in the Lord, and shall
not be weakened.</p>

<p>25:2. Prove me, O Lord, and try me; burn my reins and my heart.</p>

<p>25:3. For thy mercy is before my eyes; and I am well pleased with thy
truth.</p>

<p>25:4. I have not sat with the council of vanity: neither will I go in
with the doers of unjust things.</p>

<p>25:5. I have hated the assembly of the malignant; and with the wicked I
will not sit.</p>

<p>25:6. I will wash my hands among the innocent; and will compass thy
altar, O Lord:</p>

<p>25:7. That I may hear the voice of thy praise: and tell of all thy
wondrous works.</p>

<p>25:8. I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of thy house; and the place where
thy glory dwelleth.</p>

<p>25:9. Take not away my soul, O God, with the wicked: nor my life with
bloody men:</p>

<p>25:10. In whose hands are iniquities: their right hand is filled with
gifts.</p>

<p>25:11. But as for me, I have walked in my innocence: redeem me, and have
mercy on me.</p>

bless thee, O Lord.</p>

<p>26:1. The psalm of David before he was anointed. The Lord is my light
and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my
life: of whom shall I be afraid?</p>

<p>26:2. Whilst the wicked draw near against me, to eat my flesh. My
enemies that trouble me, have themselves been weakened, and have fallen.</p>

shall not fear. If a battle should rise up against me, in this will I be
confident.</p>

<p>26:4. One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; that I
may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. That I may
see the delight of the Lord, and may visit his temple.</p>

<p>26:5. For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle; in the day of evils, he
hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.</p>

<p>26:6. He hath exalted me upon a rock: and now he hath lifted up my head
above my enemies. I have gone round, and have offered up in his
tabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation: I will sing, and recite a psalm to
the Lord.</p>

<p>26:7. Hear, O Lord, my voice, with which I have cried to thee: have
mercy on me and hear me.</p>

<p>26:8. My heart hath said to thee: My face hath sought thee: thy face, O
Lord, will I still seek.</p>

<p>26:9. Turn not away thy face from me; decline not in thy wrath from thy
servant. Be thou my helper, forsake me not; do not thou despise me, O
God my Saviour.</p>

<p>26:10. For my father and my mother have left me: but the Lord hath taken
me up.</p>

<p>26:11. Set me, O Lord, a law in thy way, and guide me in the right path,
because of my enemies.</p>

<p>26:12. Deliver me not over to the will of them that trouble me; for
unjust witnesses have risen up against me; and iniquity hath lied to
itself.</p>

<p>26:13. I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the
living.</p>

<p>26:14. Expect the Lord, do manfully, and let thy heart take courage, and
wait thou for the Lord.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 27</p>

<p>Ad te, Domine, clamabo.</p>

<p>David's prayer that his enemies may not prevail over him.</p>

<p>27:1. A psalm for David himself. Unto thee will I cry, O Lord: O my God,
be not thou silent to me: lest if thou be silent to me, I become like
them that go down into the pit.</p>

<p>27:2. Hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication, when I pray to thee;
when I lift up my hands to thy holy temple.</p>

<p>27:3. Draw me not away together with the wicked; and with the workers of
iniquity destroy me not: Who speak peace with their neighbour, but evils
are in their hearts.</p>

<p>27:4. Give them according to their works, and according to the
wickedness of their inventions. According to the works of their hands
give thou to them: render to them their reward.</p>

<p>27:5. Because they have not understood the works of the Lord, and the
operations of his hands: thou shalt destroy them, and shalt not build
them up.</p>

<p>27:6. Blessed be the Lord, for he hath heard the voice of my
supplication.</p>

<p>27:7. The Lord is my helper andmy protector: in him hath my heart
confided, and I have been helped. And my flesh hath flourished again,
and with my will I will give praise to him.</p>

salvation of his anointed.</p>

the Lord, O ye children of God: bring to the Lord the offspring of rams.</p>

<p>28:2. Bring to the Lord glory and honour: bring to the Lord glory to his
name: adore ye the Lord in his holy court.</p>

<p>28:3. The voice of the Lord is upon the waters; the God of majesty hath
thundered, The Lord is upon many waters.</p>

<p>28:4. The voice of the Lord is in power; the voice of the Lord in
magnificence.</p>

<p>28:5. The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars: yea, the Lord shall
break the cedars of Libanus.</p>

<p>28:6. And shall reduce them to pieces, as a calf of Libanus, and as the
beloved son of unicorns.</p>

<p>Shall reduce them to pieces, etc... In Hebrew, shall make them to skip
like a calf. The psalmist here describes the effects of thunder (which
he calls the voice of the Lord) which sometimes breaks down the tallest
and strongest trees; and makes their broken branches skip, etc. All this
is to be understood mystically of the powerful voice of God's word in
his church; which has broken the pride of the great ones of this world,
and brought many of them meekly and joyfully to submit their necks to
the sweet yoke of Christ.</p>

<p>28:7. The voice of the Lord divideth the flame of fire:</p>

<p>28:8. The voice of the Lord shaketh the desert: and the Lord shall shake
the desert of Cades.</p>

<p>28:9. The voice of the Lord prepareth the stags: and he will discover
the thick woods: and in his temple all shall speak his glory.</p>

<p>28:10. The Lord maketh the flood to dwell: and the Lord shall sit king
for ever. The Lord will give strength to his people: the Lord will bless
his people with peace.</p>

him.</p>

<p>29:2. I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast upheld me: and hast not

<p>29:3. O Lord my God, I have cried to thee, and thou hast healed me.</p>

<p>29:4. Thou hast brought forth, O Lord, my soul from hell: thou hast
saved me from them that go down into the pit.</p>

<p>29:5. Sing to the Lord, O ye his saints: and give praise to the memory
of his holiness.</p>

<p>29:6. For wrath is in his indignation; and life in his good will. In the
evening weeping shall have place, and in the morning gladness.</p>

<p>29:7. And in my abundance I said: I shall never be moved.</p>

<p>29:8. O Lord, in thy favour, thou gavest strength to my beauty. Thou
turnedst away thy face from me, and I became troubled.</p>

<p>29:9. To thee, O Lord, will I cry: and I will make supplication to my
God.</p>

<p>29:10. What profit is there in my blood, whilst I go down to corruption?
Shall dust confess to thee, or declare thy truth?</p>

<p>29:11. The Lord hath heard, and hath had mercy on me: the Lord became my
helper.</p>

<p>29:12. Thou hast turned for me my mourning into joy: thou hast cut my
sackcloth, and hast compassed me with gladness:</p>

<p>29:13. To the end that my glory may sing to thee, and I may not regret:
O Lord my God, I will give praise to thee for ever.</p>

<p>30:2. In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be confounded: deliver
me in thy justice.</p>

<p>30:3. Bow down thy ear to me: make haste to deliver me. Be thou unto me
a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, to save me.</p>

<p>30:4. For thou art my strength and my refuge; and for thy name's sake
thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.</p>

<p>30:5. Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for
me: for thou art my protector.</p>

<p>30:6. Into thy hands I commend my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord,
the God of truth.</p>

<p>30:7. Thou hast hated them that regard vanities, to no purpose. But I
have hoped in the Lord:</p>

<p>30:8. I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy. For thou hast regarded my
humility, thou hast saved my soul out of distresses.</p>

<p>30:9. And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy: thou hast
set my feet in a spacious place.</p>

<p>30:10. Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: my eye is troubled
with wrath, my soul, and my belly:</p>

<p>30:11. For my life is wasted with grief: and my years in sighs. My
strength is weakened through poverty and my bones are disturbed.</p>

<p>30:12. I am become a reproach among all my enemies, and very much to my
neighbours; and a fear to my acquaintance. They that saw me without fled
from me.</p>

<p>30:13. I am forgotten as one dead from the heart. I am become as a
vessel that is destroyed.</p>

<p>30:14. For I have heard the blame of many that dwell round about. While
they assembled together against me, they consulted to take away my life.</p>

<p>30:15. But I have put my trust in thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my God.</p>

<p>30:16. My lots are in thy hands. Deliver me out of the hands of my
enemies; and from them that persecute me.</p>

<p>30:17. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me in thy mercy.</p>

<p>30:18. Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon thee.
Let the wicked be ashamed, and be brought down to hell.</p>

<p>30:19. Let deceitful lips be made dumb. Which speak iniquity against the
just, with pride and abuse.</p>

<p>30:20. O how great is the multitude of thy sweetness, O Lord, which thou
hast hidden for them that fear thee! Which thou hast wrougth for them
that hope inthee, in the sight of the sons of men.</p>

<p>30:21. Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face, from the
disturbance of men. Thoushalt protect them in thy tabernacle form the
contradiction of tongues.</p>

<p>30:22. Blessed be the Lord, for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me
in a fortified city.</p>

<p>30:23. But I said in the excess of my mind: I am cast away from before
thy eyes. Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer, when I cried
to thee.</p>

<p>30:24. O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord will require
truth, and will repay them abundantly that act proudly.</p>

<p>30:25. Do ye manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that
hope in the Lord.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 31</p>

<p>Beati quorum.</p>

<p>The second penitential psalm.</p>

<p>31:1. To David himself, understanding. Blessed are they whose iniquities
are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</p>

<p>31:2. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not inputed sin, and in
whose spirit there is no guile.</p>

<p>31:3. Because I was silent my bones grew old; whilst I cried out all the
day long.</p>

<p>Because I was silent, etc... That is, whilst I kept silence, by
concealing, or refusing to confess my sins, thy hand was heavy upon me,
etc.</p>

<p>31:4. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: I am turned in my
anguish, whilst the thorn is fastened.</p>

<p>I am turned, etc... That is, I turn and roll about in my bed to seek for
ease in my pain whilst the thorn of thy justice pierces my flesh, and
sticks fast in me. Or, I am turned: that is, I am converted to thee, my
God, by being brought to a better understanding by thy chastisements. In
the Hebrew it is, my moisture is turned into the droughts of the summer.</p>

<p>31:5. I have acknowledged my sin to thee, and my injustice I have not
concealed. I said I will confess against my self my injustice to the
Lord: and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin.</p>

<p>31:6. For this shall every one that is holy pray to thee in a seasonable
time. And yet in a flood of many waters, they shall not come nigh unto
him.</p>

<p>31:7. Thou art my fefuge from the trouble which hath eencompassed me: my
joy, deliver me from them that surround me.</p>

<p>31:8. I will give thee understanding, and I will instruct thee in this
way, in which thou shalt go: I will fix my eyes upon thee.</p>

<p>31:9. Do not become like the horse and the mule, who have no
understanding. With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, who come not
near unto thee.</p>

<p>31:10. Many are the scourges of the sinner, but mercy shall encompass
him that hopeth in the Lord.</p>

<p>31:11. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just, and glory, all ye
right of heart.</p>

the upright.</p>

<p>32:2. Give praise to the Lord on the harp; sing to him with the
psaltery, the instrument of ten strings.</p>

<p>32:3. Sing to him a new canticle, sing well unto him with a loud noise.</p>

<p>32:4. For the word of the Lord is right, and all his works are done with
faithfulness.</p>

<p>32:5. He loveth mercy and judgment; the earth is full of the mercy of
the Lord.</p>

<p>32:6. By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; and all the
power of them by the spirit of his mouth:</p>

<p>32:7. Gathering together the waters of the sea, as in a vessel; laying
up the depths in storehouses.</p>

<p>32:8. Let all the earth fear the Lord, and let all the inhabitants of
the world be in awe of him.</p>

<p>32:9. For he spoke and they were made: he commanded and they were
created.</p>

<p>32:10. The Lord bringeth to nought the counsels of nations; and he
rejecteth the devices of people, and casteth away the counsels of
princes.</p>

<p>32:11. But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever: the thoughts of
his heart to all generations.</p>

<p>32:12. Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord: the people whom he
hath chosen for his inheritance.</p>

<p>32:13. The Lord hath looked from heaven: he hath beheld all the sons of
men.</p>

<p>32:14. From his habitation which he hath prepared, he hath looked upon
all that dwell on the earth.</p>

understandeth all their works.</p>

<p>32:16. The king is not saved by a great army: nor shall the giant be
saved by his own great strength.</p>

<p>32:17. Vain is the horse for safety: neither shall he be saved by the
abundance of his strength.</p>

<p>32:18. Behold the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him: and on
them that hope in his mercy.</p>

prayers.</p>

things: to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>

<p>33:18. The just cried, and the Lord heard them: and delivered them out
of all their troubles.</p>

<p>33:19. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and he
will save the humble of spirit.</p>

the Lord deliver them.</p>

<p>33:21. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and he
will save the humble of spirit.</p>

shall be guilty.</p>

<p>33:23. The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants: and none of them
that trust in him shall offend.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 34</p>

<p>Judica, Domine, nocentes me.</p>

<p>David, in the person of Christ, prayeth against his persecutors:
prophetecally foreshewing the punishments that shall fall upon them.</p>

<p>34:1. For David himself. Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me:
overthrow them that fight against me.</p>

<p>34:2. Take hold of arms and shield: and rise up to help me.</p>

<p>34:3. Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that
persecute me: say to my soul: I am thy salvation.</p>

<p>34:4. Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul. Let
them be turned back and be confounded that devise evil against me.</p>

<p>34:5. Let them become as dust before the wind: and let the angel of the
Lord straiten them.</p>

<p>34:6. Let their way become dark and slippery; and let the angel of the
Lord pursue them.</p>

<p>34:7. For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto
destruction: without cause they have upbraided my soul.</p>

<p>34:8. Let the snae which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net
which he hath hidden catch him: and into that very snare let them fall.</p>

<p>34:9. But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; and shall be delighted in
his salvation.</p>

<p>34:10. All my bones shall say: Lord, who is like to thee? Who deliverest
the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he; the needy and
the poor from them that strip him.</p>

<p>34:11. Unjust witnesses rising up have asked me things I knew not.</p>

<p>34:12. They repaid me evil for good: to the depriving me of my soul.</p>

<p>34:13. But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, I was clothed
with haircloth. I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer shall be
turned into my bosom.</p>

<p>34:14. As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: as one
mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.</p>

<p>34:15. But they rejoiced against me, and came together: scourges were
gathered together upon me, and I knew not.</p>

<p>34:16. They were separated, and repented not: they tempted me, they
scoffed at me with scorn: they gnashed ukpon me with their teeth.</p>

<p>34:17. Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? rescue thou my soul from their
malice: my only one from the lions.</p>

<p>34:18. I will give thanks to thee in a great church; I will praise thee
in a strong people.</p>

<p>34:19. Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: who
have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes.</p>

<p>34:20. For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; and speaking in the anger
of the earth they devised guile.</p>

<p>34:21. And they opened their mouth wide against me; they said: Well
done, well done, our eyes have seen it.</p>

<p>34:22. Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: O Lord, depart not
from me.</p>

<p>34:23. Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: to my cause, my God, and
my Lord.</p>

<p>34:24. Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, and let them
not rejoice over me.</p>

<p>34:25. Let them not say in their hearts: It is well, it is well, to our
mind: neither let them say: We have swallowed him up.</p>

<p>34:26. Let them blush: and be ashamed to gether, who rejoice at my
evils. Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, who speak great
things against me.</p>

<p>34:27. Let them rejoice and be glad, who are well pleased with my
justice, and let them say always: The Lord be magnified, who delights in
the peace of his servant.</p>

<p>34:28. And my tongue shall meditate thy justice, thy praise all the day
long.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 35</p>

<p>Dixit injustus.</p>

<p>The malice of sinners, and the goodness of God.</p>

<p>35:1. Unto the end, for the servant of God, David himself.</p>

<p>35:2. The unjust hath said within himself, that he would sin: there is
no fear of God before his eyes.</p>

<p>35:3. For in his sight he hath done deceitfully, that his iniquity may
be found unto hatred.</p>

<p>Unto hatred... That is, hateful to God.</p>

<p>35:4. The words of his mouth are iniquity and guile: he would not
understand that he might do well.</p>

<p>35:5. He hath devised iniquity on his bed, he hath set himself on every
way that is not good: but evil he hath not hated.</p>

<p>35:6. O Lord, thy mercy is in heaven, and thy truth reacheth even to the
clouds.</p>

<p>35:7. Thy justice is as the mountains of God, thy judgments are a great
deep. Men and beasts thou wilt preserve, O Lord:</p>

<p>35:8. O how hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God! But the children of
men shall put their trust under the covert of thy wings.</p>

<p>35:9. They shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house; and thou
shalt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure.</p>

<p>35:10. For with thee is the fountain of life; and in thy light we shall
see light.</p>

<p>35:11. Extend thy mercy to them that know thee, and thy justice to them
that are right in heart.</p>

<p>35:12. Let not the foot of pride come to me, and let not the hand of the
sinner move me.</p>

<p>35:13. There the workers of iniquity are fallen, they are cast out, and
could not stand.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 36</p>

<p>Noli aemulari.</p>

<p>An exhortation to despise this world; and the short prosperity of the
wicked; and to trust in Providence.</p>

<p>36:1. Be not emulous of evildoers; nor envy them that work iniquity.</p>

<p>36:2. For they shall shortly wither away as grass, and as the green
herbs shall quickly fall.</p>

<p>36:3. Trust in the Lord, and do good, and dwell in the land, and thou
shalt be fed with its riches.</p>

<p>36:4. Delight in the Lord, and he will give thee the requests of thy
heart.</p>

<p>36:5. Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, and he will do it.</p>

<p>36:6. And he will bring forth thy justice as the light, and thy judgment
as the noonday.</p>

<p>36:7. Be subject to the Lord and pray to him. Envy not the man who
prospereth in his way; the man who doth unjust things.</p>

<p>36:8. Cease from anger, and leave rage; have no emulation to do evil.</p>

<p>36:9. For evildoers shall be cut off: but they that wait upon the Lord,
they shall inherit the land.</p>

<p>36:10. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: and thou
shalt seek his place, and shalt not find it.</p>

<p>36:11. But the meek shall inherit the land, and shall delight in
abundance of peace.</p>

<p>36:12. The sinner shall watch the just man: and shall gnash upon him
with his teeth.</p>

<p>36:13. But the Lord shall laugh at him: for he foreseeth that his day
shall come.</p>

<p>36:14. The wicked have drawn out the sword: they have bent their bow. To
cast down the poor and needy, to kill the upright of heart.</p>

<p>36:15. Let their sword enter into their own hearts, andlet their bow be
broken.</p>

<p>36:16. Better is a little to the just, than the great riches of the
wicked.</p>

<p>36:17. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken in pieces; but the
Lord strengtheneth the just.</p>

<p>36:18. The Lord knoweth the days of the undefiled; and their inheritance
shall be for ever.</p>

<p>36:19. They shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of
famine they shall be filled:</p>

<p>36:20. Because the wicked shall perish. And the enemies of the Lord,
presently after they shall be honoured and exalted, shall come to
nothing and vanish like smoke.</p>

<p>36:21. The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again; but the just sheweth
mercy and shall give.</p>

<p>36:22. For such as bless him shall inherit the land: but such as curse
him shall perish.</p>

<p>36:23. With the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed, and he shall
like well his way.</p>

<p>36:24. When he shall fall he shall not be bruised, for the Lord putteth
his hand under him.</p>

<p>36:25. I have been young and now am old; and I have not seen the just
forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread.</p>

<p>36:26. He sheweth mercy, and lendeth all the day long; and his seed
shall be in blessing.</p>

<p>36:27. Decline from evil and do good, and dwell for ever and ever.</p>

<p>36:28. For the Lord loveth judgment, and will not forsake his saints:
they shall be preserved for ever. The unjust shall be punished, and the
seed of the wicked shall perish.</p>

<p>36:29. But the just shall inherit the land, and shall dwell therein for
evermore.</p>

<p>36:30. The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom: and his tongue shall
speak judgment.</p>

<p>36:31. The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be
supplanted.</p>

<p>36:32. The wicked watcheth the just man, and seeketh to put him to
death,</p>

<p>36:33. But the Lord will not leave him in his hands; nor condemn him
when he shall be judged.</p>

<p>36:34. Expect the Lord and keep his way: and he will exalt thee to
inherit the land: when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see.</p>

<p>36:35. I have seen the wicked highly exalted, and lifted ukp like the
cedars of Libanus.</p>

<p>36:36. And I passed by, and lo, he was not: and I sought him and his
place was not found.</p>

<p>36:37. Keep innocence, and behold justice: for there are remnants for
the peaceable man.</p>

<p>36:38. But the unjust shall be destroyed to gether: the remnants of the
wicked shall perish.</p>

<p>36:39. But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, and he is their
protector in the time of trouble.</p>

<p>36:40. And the Lord will help them and deliver them: and he will rescue
them from the wicked, and save them because they have hoped in him.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 37</p>

<p>Domine, ne in furore.</p>

<p>A prayer of a penitent for the remission of his sins. The third
penitential psalm.</p>

<p>37:1. A psalm for David, for a remembrance of the sabbath.</p>

<p>For a remembrance... Viz., of our miseries and sins: and to be sung on
the sabbath day.</p>

<p>37:2. Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; nor chastise me in thy
wrath.</p>

<p>37:3. For thy arrows are fastened in me: and thy hand hath been strong
upon me.</p>

<p>37:4. There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath: there is no
peace for my bones, because of my sins.</p>

<p>37:5. For my iniquities are gone over my head: and as a heavy burden are
become heavy upon me.</p>

<p>37:6. My sores are putrified and corrupted, because of my foolishness.</p>

<p>37:7. I am bcome miserable, and am bowed down even to the end: I walked
sorrowfull all the day long.</p>

<p>37:8. For my loins are filled with illusions; and there isno health in
my flesh.</p>

<p>37:9. I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly: I roared with the groaning
of my heart.</p>

<p>37:10. Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hidden
from thee.</p>

<p>37:11. My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, and the light of
my eyes itself is not with me.</p>

<p>37:12. My friends and my neighbours have drawn near, and stood against
me. And they that were near me stood afar off:</p>

<p>37:13. And they that sought my soul used violence. And they that sought
evils to me spoke vain things, and studied deceits all the day long.</p>

<p>37:14. But I, as a deaf man, heard not: and as a dumb man not opening
his mouth.</p>

<p>37:15. And I became as a man that heareth not: and that hath no reproofs
in his mouth.</p>

<p>37:16. For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped: thou wilt hear me, O Lord my
God.</p>

<p>37:17. For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me: and
whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.</p>

<p>37:18. For I am ready for scourges: and my sorrow is continually before
me.</p>

<p>37:19. For I will declare my iniquity: and I will think formy sin.</p>

<p>37:20. But my enemies live, and are stronger than I: and they that hate
me wrongfully are ultiplied.</p>

<p>37:21. They that render evil for good, have detracted me, because I
followed goodness.</p>

<p>37:22. For sake me not, O Lord my God: do not thou depart from me.</p>

<p>37:23. Attend unto my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 38</p>

<p>Dixi custodiam.</p>

<p>A just man's peace and patience in his sufferings; considering the
vanity of the world, and the providence of God.</p>

<p>38:1. Unto the end, for Idithun himself, a canticle of David.</p>

<p>38:2. I said: I will take heed to my ways: that I sin not with my
tongue. I have set a guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against
me.</p>

<p>38:3. I was dumb, and was humbled, and kept silence from good things:
and my sorrow was renewed.</p>

<p>38:4. My heart grew hot within me: and in my meditqation a fire shall
flame out.</p>

<p>38:5. I spoke with my tongue: O Lord, make me know my end. And what is
the number of my days: that I may know what is wanting to me.</p>

<p>38:6. Behold thou hast made my days measurable and my substance is as
nothing before thee. And indeed all things are vantiy: every man living.</p>

<p>38:7. Surely man passeth as an image: yea, and he is disquieted in vain.
He storeth up: and he knoweth not for whom he shall gather these things.</p>

<p>38:8. And now what is my hope? is it not the Lord? and my substance is
with thee.</p>

<p>38:9. Deliver thou me from all my iniquities: thou hast made me a
reproach to the fool.</p>

<p>38:10. I was dumb, and I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done it.</p>

<p>38:11. Remove thy scourges from me. The strength of thy hand hath made
me faint in rebukes:</p>

<p>38:12. Thou hast corrected man for iniquity. And thou hast made his soul
to waste away like a spider: surely in vain is any man disquieted.</p>

<p>38:13. Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication: give ear to my
tears. Be no silent: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as
all my fathers were.</p>

<p>38:14. O forgive me, that I may be refreshed, before I go hence, and be
no more.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 39</p>

<p>Expectans expectavi.</p>

<p>Christ's coming, and redeeming mankind.</p>

<p>39:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David himself.</p>

<p>39:2. With expectation I have waited for the Lord, and he was attentive
to me.</p>

<p>39:3. And he heard my prayers, and brought me out of the pit of misery
and the mire of dregs. And he set my feet upon a rock, and directed my
steps.</p>

<p>39:4. And he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many
shall see, and shall fear: and they shall hope in the Lord.</p>

<p>39:5. Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord; and who
hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies.</p>

<p>39:6. Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord my God: and in
thy thoughts there is no one like to thee. I have declared and I have
spoken they are multiplied above number.</p>

<p>39:7. Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; but thou hast
pierced ears for me. Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not
require:</p>

<p>39:8. Then said I, Behold I come. In the head of the book it is written
of me</p>

<p>39:9. That I should do thy will: O my God, I have desired it, and thy
law in the midst of my heart.</p>

<p>39:10. I have declared thy justice in a great church, lo, I will not
restrain my lips: O Lord, thou knowest it.</p>

<p>39:11. I have not hid thy justice within my heart: I have declared thy
truth and thy salvation. I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth
from a great council.</p>

<p>39:12. Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me: thy mercy
and thy truth have always upheld me.</p>

<p>39:13. For evils without number have surrounded me; my iniquities have
overtaken me, and I was not able to see. They are multiplied above the
hairs of my head: and my heart hath forsaken me.</p>

<p>My iniquities... That is, the sins of all mankind, which I have taken
upon me.</p>

<p>39:14. Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me. Look down, O Lord, to help me.</p>

<p>39:15. Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that seek after my
soul to take it away. Let them be turned backward and be ashamed that
desire evils to me.</p>

<p>39:16. Let them immediately bear their confusion, that say to me: 'T is
well, t' is well.</p>

<p>'T is well... The Hebrew here is an interjection of insult and derision,
like the Vah. Matt. 27.49.</p>

<p>39:17. Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such
as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.</p>

<p>39:18. But I am a beggar and poor: the Lord is careful for me. Thou art
my helper and my protector: O my God, be not slack.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 40</p>

<p>Beatus qui intelligit.</p>

<p>The happiness of him that shall believe in Christ; notwithstanding the
humility and poverty in which he shall come: the malice of his enemies,
especially of the traitor Judas.</p>

<p>40:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David himself.</p>

<p>40:2. Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the
poor: the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.</p>

<p>40:3. The Lord preserve him and give him life, and make him blessed upon
the earth: and deliver him not up to the will of his enemies.</p>

<p>40:4. The Lord help him on his bed of sorrow: thou hast turned all his
couch in his sickness.</p>

<p>40:5. I said: O Lord, be thou merciful to me: heal my soul, for I have
sinned against thee.</p>

<p>40:6. My enemies have spoken evils against me: when shall he die and his
name perish?</p>

<p>40:7. And if he came in to see me, he spoke vain things: his heart
gathered together iniquity to itself. He went out and spoke to the same
purpose.</p>

<p>40:8. All my enemies whispered together against me: they devised evils
to me.</p>

<p>40:9. They determined against me an unjust word: shall he that sleepeth
rise again no more?</p>

<p>40:10. For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my
bread, hath greatly supplanted me.</p>

<p>40:11. But thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise my up again: and I
will requite them.</p>

<p>40:12. By this I know, that thou hast had a good will for me: because my
enemy shall not rejoice over me.</p>

<p>40:13. But thou hast upheldme by reason of my innocence: and hast
established me in thy sight for ever.</p>

<p>40:14. Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity.
So be it. So be it.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 41</p>

<p>Quemadmodum desiderat.</p>

<p>The fervent desire of the just after God: hope in afflictions.</p>

<p>41:1. Unto the end, understanding for the sons of Core.</p>

<p>41:2. As the hart panteth after the fountains of water; so my soul
panteth after thee, O God.</p>

<p>41:3. My soul hath thirsted after the strong living God; when shall I
come and appear before the face of God?</p>

<p>41:4. My tears have been my bread day and night, whilst it is said to me
daily: Where is thy God?</p>

<p>41:5. These things I remembered, and poured out my soul in me: for I
shall go over into the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even to the
house of God: With the voice of joy and praise; the noise of one
feasting.</p>

<p>41:6. Why art thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou trouble me? Hope in
God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of my
countenance,</p>

<p>41:7. And my God. My soul is troubled within my self: therefore will I
remember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermoniim, from the little
hill.</p>

<p>41:8. Deep calleth on deep, at the noise of thy flood-gates. All thy
heights and thy billows have passed over me.</p>

<p>41:9. In the daytime the Lord hath commanded hismercy; and a canticle to
him in the night. With me is prayer to the God of my life.</p>

<p>41:10. I will say to God: Thou art my support. Why hast thou forgotten
me? and why go I mourning, whilst my enemy afflicteth me?</p>

<p>41:11. Whilst my bones are broken, my enemies who troubleme have
reproached me; Whilst they say to me day be day: Where is thy God?</p>

<p>41:12. Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me?
Hope thou in God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of
my countenance, and my God.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 42</p>

<p>Judica me, Deus.</p>

<p>The prophet aspireth after the temple and altar of God.</p>

<p>42:1. A psalm for David. Judge me, O God, and distinguish my cause from
the nation that is not holy: deliver me from the unjust and deceitful
man.</p>

<p>42:2. For thou art God my strrength: why hast thou cast me off? and why
do I go sorrowful whilst the enemy afflicteth me?</p>

<p>42:3. Sent forth thy light and thy truth: they have conducted me, and
brought me unto thy holy hill, and into thy tabernacles.</p>

<p>42:4. And I will go in to the altar of God: to God who giveth joy to my
youth.</p>

<p>42:5. To thee, O God my God, I will give praise upon the harp: why art
thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me?</p>

<p>42:6. Hope in God, for I will still give pralise to him: the salvation
of my countenance, and my God.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 43</p>

<p>Deus auribus nostris.</p>

<p>The church commemorates former favours, and present afflictions; under
which she prays for succour.</p>

<p>43:1. Unto the end, for the sons of Core, to give understanding.</p>

<p>43:2. We have heard, O God, with our ears: our fathers have declared to
us, The work thou hast wrought in their days, and in the days of old.</p>

<p>43:3. Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles, and thou plantedst them: thou
didst aflict the people and cast them out.</p>

<p>43:4. For they got not the possession of the land by their own sword:
neither did their own arm save them. But thy right hand and thy arm, and
the light of thy countenance: because thou wast pleased with them.</p>

<p>43:5. Thou art thyself my king andmy God, who commandest the saving of
Jacob.</p>

<p>43:6. Through thee we will push down our enemies with the horn: and
through thy name we will despise them that rise up against us.</p>

<p>43:7. For I will not trust in my bow: neither shall my sword save me.</p>

<p>43:8. But thou hast saved us from them that afflict us: and hast put
them to shame that hate us.</p>

<p>43:9. In God shall we glory all the day long: and in thy name we will
give praise for ever.</p>

<p>43:10. But now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame: and thou,
O God, wilt not go out with our armies.</p>

<p>43:11. Thou hast made kus turn our back to our enemies: and they that
hated us plundered for themselves.</p>

<p>43:12. Thou hast given us up like sheep to be eaten: thou hast scattered
us among the nations.</p>

<p>43:13. Thou hast sold thy people for no price: and there was no
reckoning in the exchange of them.</p>

<p>43:14. Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scoff and
derision to them that are round about us.</p>

<p>43:15. Thou hast made us a byword among the Gentiles: a shaking of the
head among the people.</p>

<p>43:16. All the day long my shame is before me: and the confusion of my
face hath covered me,</p>

<p>43:17. At the voice of him that reproacheth and detracteth me: at the
face of the enemy and persecutor.</p>

<p>43:18. All these things have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten
thee: and we have not done wickedly in thy covenant.</p>

<p>43:19. And our heart hath not turned back: neither hast thou turned
aside our steps from thy way.</p>

<p>43:20. For thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction: and the
shadow of death hath covered us.</p>

<p>43:21. If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread
forth our hands to a strange god:</p>

<p>43:22. Shall not God search out thesethings: for he knoweth the secrets
of the heart. Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long: we
are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</p>

<p>43:23. Arise, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, and cast us not off to
the end.</p>

<p>43:24. Why turnest thou thy face away? and forgettest our want and our
trouble?</p>

<p>43:25. For our soul is humbled down to the dust: our belly cleaveth to
the earth.</p>

<p>43:26. Arise, O Lord, help us and redeem us for thy name's sake.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 44</p>

<p>Eructavit cor meum.</p>

<p>The excellence of Christ's kingdom, and the endowments of his church.</p>

<p>44:1. Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, for the sons of
Core, for understanding. A canticle for the Beloved.</p>

<p>For them that shall be changed... i.e., for souls happily changed, by
being converted to God.-Ibid. The Beloved... Viz., Our Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>44:2. My heart hath uttered a good word: I speak my works to the king:
My tongue is the pen of a scrivener that writeth swiftly.</p>

<p>44:3. Thou art beautiful above the sons of men: grace is poured abroad
in thy lips; therefore hath God blessed thee for ever.</p>

<p>44:4. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most mighty.</p>

<p>44:5. With thy comeliness and thy beauty set out, proceed prosperously,
and reign. Because of truth and meekness and justice: and thy right hand
shall conduct thee wonderfully.</p>

<p>44:6. Thy arrows are sharp: under thee shall people fall, into the
hearts of the king's enemies.</p>

<p>44:7. Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom
is a sceptre of uprightness.</p>

<p>44:8. Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy
God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</p>

<p>44:9. Myrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments, from the ivory
houses: out of which</p>

<p>44:10. The daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory. The
queen stood on thy right hand, in gilded clothing; surrounded with
variety.</p>

<p>44:11. Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thy ear: and forget thy
people and thy father's house.</p>

<p>44:12. And the king shall greatly desire thy beauty; for he is the Lord
thy God, and him they shall adore.</p>

<p>44:13. And the daughters of Tyre with gifts, yea, all the rich among the
people, shall entreat thy countenance.</p>

<p>44:14. All the glory of the king's daughter is within in golden borders,</p>

brought into the temple of the king.</p>

have found us exceedingly.</p>

nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.</p>

gathered together.</p>

<p>47:6. So they saw, and they wondered, they were troubled, they were
moved:</p>

Tharsis.</p>

ye may relate it in another generation.</p>

<p>47:15. For this is God, our God unto eternity, and for ever and ever: he
shall rule us for evermore.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 48</p>

<p>Audite haec, omnes gentes.</p>

<p>The folly of worldlings, who live on in sin, without thinking of death
or hell.</p>

<p>48:1. Unto the end, a psalm for the sons of Core.</p>

<p>48:2. Hear these things, all ye nations: give ear, all ye inhabitants of
the world.</p>

<p>48:3. All you that are earthborn, and you sons of men: both rich and
poor together.</p>

<p>48:4. My mouth shall speak wisdom: and the meditation of my heart
understanding.</p>

<p>48:5. I will incline my ear to a parable; I will open my proposition on
the psaltery.</p>

<p>48:6. Why shall I fear in the evil day? the iniquity of my heel shall
encompass me.</p>

<p>The iniquity of my heel... That is, the iniquity of my steps or ways: or
the iniquity of my pride, with which as with the heel, I have spurned
and kicked at my neighbours: or the iniquity of my heel, that is, the
iniquity in which I shall be found in death. The meaning of this verse
is, Why should I now indulge those passions and sinful affections, or
commit now those sins, which will cause me so much fear and anguish in
the evil day; when the sorrows of death shall compass me, and the perils
of hell shall find me?</p>

<p>48:7. They that trust in their own strength, and glory in the multitude
of their riches,</p>

<p>They that trust, etc... As much as to say, let them fear that trust in
their strength or riches: for they have great reason to fear: seeing no
brother or other man, how much a friend soever, can by any price or
labour rescue them from death.</p>

<p>48:8. No brother can redeem, nor shall man redeem: he shall not give to
God his ransom,</p>

<p>48:9. Nor the price of the redemption of his soul: and shall labour for
ever,</p>

<p>And shall labour for ever, etc... This seems to be a continuation of the
foregoing sentence: as much as to say no man can by any price or ransom
prolong his life, that so he may still continue to labour here, and live
to the end of the world. Others understand it of the eternal sorrows,
and dying life of hell, which is the dreadful consequence of dying in
sin.</p>

<p>48:10. And shall still live unto the end.</p>

<p>48:11. He shall not see destruction, when he shall see the wise dying:
the senseless and the fool shall perish together: And they shall leave
their riches to strangers:</p>

<p>He shall not see destruction, etc... Or, shall he not see destruction?
As much as to say, however thoughtless he may be of his death, he must
not expect to escape; when even the wise and the good are not exempt
from dying.</p>

<p>48:12. And their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever. Their
dwelling places to all generations: they have called their lands by
their names.</p>

<p>They have called, etc... That is, they have left their names on their
graves, which alone remain of their lands.</p>

<p>48:13. And man when he was in honour did not understand; he is compared
to senseless beasts, and is become like to them.</p>

<p>48:14. This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them: and afterwards
they shall delight in their mouth.</p>

<p>They shall delight in their mouth... Notwithstanding the wretched way in
which they walk, they shall applaud themselves with their mouths, and
glory in their doings.</p>

<p>48:15. They are laid in hell like sheep: death shall feed upon them. And
the just shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their help
shall decay in hell from their glory.</p>

<p>In the morning... That is, in the resurrection to a new life; when the
just shall judge and condemn the wicked. Ibid. From their glory... That
is, when their short-lived glory in this world shall be past, and be no
more.</p>

<p>48:16. But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when he shall
receive me.</p>

<p>48:17. Be not thou afraid, when a man shall be made rick, and when the
glory of his house shall be increased.</p>

<p>48:18. For when he shall die he shall take nothing away; nor shall his
glory descend with him.</p>

<p>48:19. For in his lifetime his soul will be blessed: and he will praise
thee when thou shalt do well to him.</p>

<p>48:20. He shall g in to the gneerations of his fathers: and he shall
never see light.</p>

<p>48:21. Man when he was in honour did not understand: he hath been
compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 49</p>

<p>Deus deorum.</p>

<p>The coming of Christ: who prefers virtue and inward purity before the
blood of victims.</p>

<p>49:1. A psalm for Asaph. The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken: and he
hath called the earth. From the rising of the sun, to the going down
thereof:</p>

<p>49:2. Out of Sion the loveliness of his beauty.</p>

<p>49:3. God shall come manifestly: our God shall come, and shall not keep
silence. A fire shall burn before him: and a mighty tempest shall be
round about him.</p>

<p>49:4. He shall call heraven from above, and the earth, to judge his
people.</p>

<p>49:5. Gather ye together his saints to him: who set his covenant before
sacrifices.</p>

<p>49:6. And the heavens shall declare his justice: for God is judge.</p>

<p>49:7. Hear, O my people, and I will speak: O Israel, and I will testify
to thee: I am God, thy God.</p>

<p>49:8. I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices: and thy burnt
offerings are always in my sight.</p>

<p>49:9. I will not take calves out of thy house: nor he goats out of thy
flocks.</p>

<p>49:10. For all the beasts of the woods are mine: the cattle on the
hills, and the oxen.</p>

<p>49:11. I know all the fowls of the air: and with me is the beauty of the
field.</p>

<p>49:12. If I should be hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is
mine, and the fulness thereof.</p>

<p>49:13. Shall I eat the flesh of bullocks? or shall I drink the blood of
goats?</p>

<p>49:14. Offer to God the sacrifice of praise: and pay thy vows to the
most High.</p>

<p>49:15. And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify me.</p>

<p>49:16. But to the sinner God hath said: Why dost thou declare my
justices, and take my covenant in thy mouth?</p>

<p>49:17. Seeing thou hast hated discipline: and hast cast my words behind
thee.</p>

<p>49:18. If thou didst see a thief thou didst run with him: and with
adulterers thou hast been a partaker.</p>

<p>49:19. Thy mouth hath abounded with evil, and thy tongue framed deceits.</p>

<p>49:20. Sitting thou didst speak against thy brother, and didst lay a
scandal against thy mother's son:</p>

<p>49:21. These things hast thou done, and I was silent. Thou thoughtest
unjustly that I should be like to thee: but I will reprove thee, and set
before thy face.</p>

<p>49:22. Understand these things, you that forget God; lest he snatch you
away, and there be none to deliver you.</p>

<p>49:23. The sacrifice of praise shall glorify me: and there is the way by
which I will shew him the salvation of God.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 50</p>

<p>Miserere.</p>

<p>The repentance and confession of David after his sin. The fourth
penitential psalm.</p>

<p>50:1. Unto the end, a psalm of David,</p>

<p>50:2. When Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had sinned with
Bethsabee. [2 Kings 12.]</p>

<p>50:3. Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy great mercy. And
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my iniquity.</p>

<p>50:4. Wash me yet more from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.</p>

<p>50:5. For I know my iniquity, and my sin is always before me.</p>

<p>50:6. To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil befoer thee: that
thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art
judged.</p>

<p>50:7. For behold I was conceived in iniquities; and in sins did my
mother conceive me.</p>

<p>50:8. For behold thou hast loved truth: the uncertain and hidden things
of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.</p>

<p>50:9. Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: thou
shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.</p>

<p>50:10. To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: and the bones
that have been humbled shall rejoice.</p>

<p>50:11. Tukrn away thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.</p>

<p>50:12. Create a clean heart in me, O God: and renew a right spirit
within my bowels.</p>

<p>50:13. Cast me not away from thy face; and take not thy holy spirit from
me.</p>

<p>50:14. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and strengthen me with
a perfect spirit.</p>

<p>50:15. I will teach the unjust thy ways: and the wicked shall be
converted to thee.</p>

<p>50:16. Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my
tongue shall extol thy justice.</p>

<p>50:17. O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: and my mouth shall declare thy
praise.</p>

<p>50:18. For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given
it: with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.</p>

<p>50:19. A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: a contrite and humbled
heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</p>

<p>50:20. Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; that the
walls of Jerusalem may be built up.</p>

<p>50:21. Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and
whole burnt offerings: then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 51</p>

<p>Quid gloriaris.</p>

<p>David condemneth the wickedness of Doeg, and foretelleth his
destruction.</p>

<p>51:1. Unto the end, understanding for David,</p>

<p>51:2. When Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul: David went to the house
of Achimelech.</p>

<p>51:3. Why dost thou glory in malice, thou that art mighty in iniquity?</p>

<p>51:4. All the day long thy tongue hath devised injustice: as a sharp
razor, thou hast wrought deceit.</p>

<p>51:5. Thou hast loved malice more than goodness: and iniquity rather
than to speak righteousness.</p>

<p>51:6. Thou hast loved all the words of ruin, O deceitful tongue.</p>

<p>51:7. Therefore will God destroy thee for ever: he will pluck thee out,
and remove thee from thy dwelling place: and thy root out of the land of
the living.</p>

<p>51:8. The just shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say:</p>

<p>51:9. Behold the man that made not God his helper: But trusted in the
abundance of his riches: and prevailed in his vanity.</p>

<p>51:10. But I, as a fruitful olive tree in the house of God, have hoped
in the mercy of God for ever, yea for ever and ever.</p>

<p>51:11. I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I
will wait on thy name, for it is good in the sight of thy saints.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 52</p>

<p>Dixit insipiens.</p>

<p>The general corruption of man before the coming of Christ.</p>

<p>52:1. Unto the end, for Maeleth, understandings to David. The fool said
in his heart: There is no God.</p>

<p>Maeleth... Or Machalath. A musical instrument, or a chorus of musicians,
for St. Jerome renders it, per chorum.</p>

<p>52:2. They are corrupted, and become abominable in iniquities: there is
none that doth good.</p>

<p>52:3. God looked down from heaven on the children of men: to see if
there were any that did understand, or did seek God.</p>

<p>52:4. All have gone aside, they are become unprofitable toegther, there
is none that doth good, no not one.</p>

<p>52:5. Shall not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat up my people
as they eat bread?</p>

<p>52:6. They have not called upon God: there have they trembled for fear,
where there was no fear. For God hath scattered the bones of them that
please men: they have been confounded, because God hath despised them.</p>

<p>God hath scattered the bones, etc... That is, God has brought to nothing
the strength of all those that seek to please men, to the prejudice of
their duty to their Maker.</p>

<p>52:7. Who will give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when God shall
bring back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel
shall be glad.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 53</p>

<p>Deus, in nomine tuo.</p>

<p>A prayer for help in destress.</p>

<p>53:1. Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David.</p>

<p>
53:2. When the en of Ziph had come and said to Saul: Is not David hidden
with us? [1 Kings 23.19]</p>

<p>53:3. Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy strength.</p>

<p>53:4. O God, hear my lprayer: give ear to the words of my mouth.</p>

<p>53:5. For strangers have rrisen up against me; and the mighty have
sought after my soul: and they have not set God before their eyes.</p>

<p>53:6. For behold God is my helper: and the Lord is the protector of my
soul.</p>

<p>53:7. Turn back the evils upon my enemies; and cut them off in thy
truth.</p>

<p>53:8. I will freely sacrifice to thee, and will give praise, O God, to
thy name: because it is good:</p>

<p>53:9. For thou hast delivered me out of all trouble: and my eye hath
looked down upon my enemies.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 54</p>

<p>Exaudi, Deus.</p>

<p>A prayer of a just man under persecution from the wicked. It agrees to
Christ persecuted by the Jews, and betrayed by Judas.</p>

<p>54:1. Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David.</p>

<p>54:2. Hear, O God, my prayer, and despise not lmy supplication:</p>

<p>54:3. Be attentive to me and hear me. I am grieved in my exercise; and
am troubled,</p>

<p>54:4. At the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner.
For they have cast iniquities upon me: and in wrath they were
troublesome to me.</p>

<p>54:5. My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen
upon me.</p>

<p>54:6. Fear and trembling are come upon me: and darkness hath covered me.</p>

<p>54:7. And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and
be at rest?</p>

<p>54:8. Lo, I have gone far off flying away; and I abode in the
wilderness.</p>

<p>54:9. I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit,
and a storm.</p>

<p>54:10. Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen
iniquity and contradiction in the city.</p>

<p>54:11. Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: and in
the midst thereof arelabour,</p>

<p>54:12. And injustice. And usury and deceit have not departed from its
streets.</p>

<p>54:13. For if my enemy had reviled me, I would verily have borne with
it. And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, I would
perhaps have hidden my self from him.</p>

<p>54:14. But thou a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar,</p>

<p>54:15. Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: in the house of God
we walked with consent.</p>

<p>54:16. Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell.
For there is wickedness in their dwellings: in the midst of them.</p>

<p>Let death, etc... This, and such like imprecations which occur in the
psalms, are delivered prophetically; that is, by way of foretelling the
punishments which shall fall upon the wicked from divine justice, and
approving the righteous ways of God: but not by way of ill will, or
uncharitable curses, which the law of God disallows.</p>

<p>54:17. But I have cried to God: and the Lord will save me.</p>

<p>54:18. Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: and he
shall hear my voice.</p>

<p>54:19. He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me:
for among many they were with me.</p>

<p>Among many, etc... That is, they that drew near to attack me were many
in company all combined to fight against me.</p>

<p>54:20. God shall hear, and the Eternal shall humble them. For there is
no change with them, and they have not feared God:</p>

<p>54:21. He hath stretched forth his hand to repay. They have defiled his
covenant,</p>

<p>54:22. They are divided by the wrath of his countenance, and his heart
hath drawn near. His words are smoother tha oil, and the same are darts.</p>

<p>They are divided, etc... Dispersed, scattered, and brought to nothing,
by the wrath of God; who looks with indignation on their wicked and
deceitful ways.</p>

<p>54:23. Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall
not suffer the just to waver for ever.</p>

<p>54:24. But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of
destruction. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their
days; but I will trust in thee, O Lord.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 55</p>

<p>Miserere mei, Deus.</p>

<p>A prayer of David in danger and distress.</p>

<p>55:1. Unto the end, for a people that is removed at a distance form the
sanctuary: for David, for an inscription of a title (or pillar) when the
Philistines held him in Geth.</p>

<p>55:2. Have mercy on me, O God, for man hath trodden me under foot; all
the day long he hath afflicted me fighting against me.</p>

<p>55:3. My enemies have trodden on me all the day long; for they are many
that make war against me.</p>

<p>55:4. From the height of the day I shall fear: but I will trust in thee.</p>

<p>The height of the day... That is, even at noonday, when the sun is the
highest, I am still in danger.</p>

<p>55:5. In God I will praise my words, in God I have put my trust: I will
not fear what flesh can do against me.</p>

<p>My words... The words or promises God has made in my favour.</p>

<p>55:6. All the day long they detested my words: all their thoughts were
against me unto evil.</p>

<p>55:7. They will dwell and hide themselves: they will watch my heel. As
they have waited for my soul,</p>

<p>55:8. For nothing shalt thou save them: in thy anger thou shalt break
the people in pieces. O God,</p>

<p>For nothing shalt thou save them... That is, since they lie in wait to
ruin my soul, thou shalt for no consideration favour or assist them, but
execute thy justice upon them.</p>

<p>55:9. I have declared to thee my life: thou hast set me tears in thy
sight, As also in thy promise.</p>

<p>55:10. Then shall my enemies be turned back. In what day soever I shall
call upon thee, behold I know thou art my God.</p>

<p>55:11. In God will I praise the word, in the Lord will I praise his
speech. In God have I hoped, I will not fear what man can do to me.</p>

<p>55:12. In me, O God, are vows to thee, which I will lpay, praises to
thee:</p>

<p>55:13. Because thou hast delivered my soul from death, my feet from
falling: that I may please in the sight of God, in the light of the
living.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 56</p>

<p>Miserere mei, Deus. The prophet prays in his affliction, and praises God
for his delivery.</p>

<p>56:1. Unto the end, destroy not, for David, for an inscription of a
title, when he fled from Saul into the cave. [1 Kings 24.]</p>

<p>Destroy not... Suffer me not to be destroyed.</p>

<p>56:2. Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me: for my soul trusteth in
thee. And in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, until iniquity pass
away.</p>

<p>56:3. I will cry to God the most high; to God who hath done good to me.</p>

<p>56:4. He hath sent from heaven and delivered me: he hath made them a
reproach that trod upon me. God hath sent his mercy and his truth,</p>

<p>56:5. And he hath delivered my soul from the midst of the young lions. I
slept troubled. The sons ofmen, whose teeth are weapons and arrows, and
their tongue a sharp sword.</p>

<p>56:6. Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory above all
the earth.</p>

<p>56:7. They prepared a snare for my feet; and they bowed down my soul.
They dug a pit before my face, and they are fallen into it.</p>

<p>56:8. My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: I will sing, and
rehearse a psalm.</p>

<p>56:9. Arise, O my glory, arise psaltery and harp: I will arise early.</p>

<p>56:10. I will give praise to thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing
a psalm to thee among the nations.</p>

<p>56:11. For thy mercy is magnified even to the heavens: and thy truth
unto the clouds.</p>

<p>56:12. Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
all the earth.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 57</p>

<p>Si vere utique.</p>

<p>David reproveth the wicked, and foretelleth their punishment.</p>

<p>57:1. Unto the end, destroy not, for David, for an inscription of a
title.</p>

<p>57:2. If in very deed ye speak justice: judge right things, ye sons of
men.</p>

<p>57:3. For in your heart you work iniquity: your hands forge injustice in
the earth.</p>

<p>57:4. The wicked are alienated from the womb; they have gone astray from
the womb: they have spoken false things.</p>

<p>57:5. Their madness is according to the likeness of a serpent: like the
deaf asp that stoppeth her ears:</p>

<p>57:6. Which will not hear the voice of the charmers; nor of the wizard
that charmeth wisely.</p>

<p>57:7. God shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth: the Lord
shall break the grinders of the lions.</p>

<p>57:8. They shall come to nothing, like water running down; he hath bent
his bow till they be weakened.</p>

<p>57:9. Like wax that melteth they shall be taken away: fire hath fallen
on them, and they shall not see the sun.</p>

<p>57:10. Before your thorns could know the brier; he swalloweth them up,
as alive, in his wrath.</p>

<p>Before your thorns, etc... That is, before your thorns grow up, so as to
become strong briers, they shall be overtaken and consumed by divine
justice, swallowing them up, as it were, alive in his wrath.</p>

<p>57:11. The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge: he shall
wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.</p>

<p>Shall wash his hands, etc... Shall applaud the justice of God, and take
occasion from the consideration of the punishment of the wicked to wash
and cleanse his hands from sin.</p>

<p>57:12. And man shall say: If indeed there be fruit to the just: there is
indeed a God that judgeth them on the earth.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 58</p>

<p>Eripe me.</p>

<p>A prayer to be delivered from the wicked, with confidence in God's help
and protection. It agrees to Christ and his enemies the Jews.</p>

<p>58:1. Unto the end, destroy not, for David for an inscription of a
title, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill him. [1 Kings 19.]</p>

<p>58:2. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; and defend me from them that
rise up against me.</p>

<p>58:3. Deliver me from them that work iniquity, and save me from bloody
men.</p>

<p>58:4. For behold they have caught my soul: the mighty have rushed in
upon me:</p>

<p>58:5. Neither is it my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord: without iniquity
have I ren, and directed my steps.</p>

<p>58:6. Rise up thou to meet me, and behold: even thou, O Lord, the God of
hosts, the God of Israel. Attend to visit all the nations: have no mercy
on all them that work iniquity.</p>

<p>58:7. They shall return at everning, and shall suffer hunger like dogs:
and shall go round about the city.</p>

<p>58:8. Behold they shall speak with their mouth, and a sword is in their
lips: for who, say they, hath heard us?</p>

<p>58:9. But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them: thou shalt bring all the
nations to nothing.</p>

<p>58:10. I will keep my strength to thee: for thou art my protector:</p>

<p>58:11. My God, his mercy shall prevent me.</p>

<p>58:12. God shall let me see over my enemies: slay them not, lest at any
time my people forget. Scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O
Lord, my protector:</p>

<p>58:13. For the sin of their mouth, and the word of their lips: and let
them be taken in their pride. And for their cursing and lying they shall
be talked of,</p>

<p>58:14. When they are consumed: when they are consumed by thy wrath, and
they shall be no more. And they shall know that God will rule Jacob, and
all the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>58:15. They shall return at evening and shall suffer hunger like dogs:
and shall go round about the city.</p>

<p>58:16. They shall be scattered abroad to eat, and shall murmur if they
be not filled.</p>

<p>58:17. But I will sing thy strength: and will extol thy mercy in the
morning. For thou art become my support, and my refuge, in the day of my
trouble.</p>

<p>58:18. Unto thee, O my helper, will I sing, for thou art God my defence:
my God my mercy.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 59</p>

<p>Deus, repulisti nos.</p>

<p>After many afflictions, the church of Christ shall prevail.</p>

<p>59:1. Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, for the inscription
of a title, to David himself, for doctrine,</p>

<p>59:2. When he set fire to Mesopotamia of Syria and Sobal: and Joab
returned and slew of Edom, in the vale of the saltpits, twelve thousand
men.</p>

<p>59:3. O God, thou hast cast us off, and hast destroyed us; thou hast
been angry, and hast had mercy on us.</p>

<p>59:4. Thou hast moved the earth, and hast troubled it: heal thou the
breaches thereof, for it has been moved.</p>

<p>59:5. Thou hast shewn thy people hard things; thou hast made us drink
the wine of sorrow.</p>

<p>59:6. Thou hast given a warning to them that fear thee: that they may
flee from before the bow: That thy beloved may be delivered.</p>

<p>59:7. Save me with thy right hand, and hear me.</p>

<p>59:8. God hath spoken in his holy place: I will rejoice, and I will
divide Sichem; and will mete out the vale of tabernacles.</p>

<p>59:9. Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine: and Ephraim is the strength
of my head. Juda is my king:</p>

<p>59:10. Moab is the pot of my hope. Into Edom will I stretch out my shoe:
to me the foreigners are made subject.</p>

<p>The pot of my hope... Or my watering pot. That is, a vessel for meaner
uses, by being reduced to serve me, even in the meanest employments.
Ibid. Foreigners... So the Philistines are called, who had no kindred
with the Israelites; whereas the Edomites, Moabites, etc., were
originally of the same family.</p>

<p>59:11. Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
Edom?</p>

<p>59:12. Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O
God, go out with our armies?</p>

<p>59:13. Give us help from trouble: for vain is the salvation of man.</p>

<p>59:14. Through God we shall do mightily: and he shall bring to nothing
them that afflict us.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 60</p>

<p>Exaudi, Deus.</p>

<p>A prayer for the coming of the kingdom of Christ, which shall have no
end.</p>

<p>60:1. Unto the end, in hymns, for David.</p>

<p>60:2. Hear, O God, my supplication: be attentive to my prayer.</p>

<p>60:3. To thee have I cried from the ends of the earth: when my heart was
in anguish, thou hast exalted me on a rock. Thou hast conducted me;</p>

<p>60:4. For thou hast been my hope; a tower of strength against the face
of the enemy.</p>

<p>60:5. In thy tabernacle I shall dwell for ever: I shall be protected
under the covert of thy wings.</p>

<p>60:6. For thou, my God, hast heard my prayer: thou hast given an
inheritance to them that fear thy name.</p>

<p>60:7. Thou wilt add days to the days of the king: his years even to
generation and generation.</p>

<p>60:8. He abideth for ever in the sight of God: his mercy and truth who
shall search?</p>

<p>60:9. So will I sing a psalm to thy name for ever and ever: that I may
pay my vows from day to day.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 61</p>

<p>Nonne Deo.</p>

<p>The prophet encourageth himself and all others to trust in God, and
serve him.</p>

<p>61:1. Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of David.</p>

<p>61:2. Shall not my soul be subject to God? for from him is my salvation.</p>

<p>61:3. For he is my God and my saviour: he is my protector, I shall be
moved no more.</p>

<p>61:4. How long do you rush in upon a man? you all kill, as if you were
thrusting down a leaning wall, and a tottering fence.</p>

<p>61:5. But they have thought to cast away my price; I ran in thirst: they
blessed with their mouth, but cursed with their heart.</p>

<p>61:6. But be thou, O my soul, subject to God: for from him is my
patience.</p>

<p>61:7. For he is my God and my saviour: he is my helper, I shall not be
moved.</p>

<p>61:8. In God is my salvation and my glory: he is the God of my help, and
my hope is in God.</p>

<p>61:9. Trust in him, all ye congregation of people: pour out your hearts
before him. God is our helper for ever.</p>

<p>61:10. But vain are the sons of men, the sons of men are liars in the
balances: that by vanity they may together deceive.</p>

<p>Are liars in the balances, etc... They are so vain and light, that if
they are put into the scales, they will be found to be of no weight; and
to be mere lies, deceit, and vanity. Or, They are liars in their
balances, by weighing things by false weights, and preferring the
temporal before the eternal.</p>

<p>61:11. Trust not in iniquity, and cover not robberies: if riches abound,
set not your heart upon them.</p>

<p>61:12. God hath spoken once, these two things have I heard, that power
belongeth to God,</p>

<p>61:13. And mercy to thee, O Lord; for thou wilt render to every man
according to his works.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 62</p>

<p>Deus Deus meus, ad te.</p>

<p>The prophet aspireth after God.</p>

<p>62:1. A psalm of David while he was in the desert of Edom.</p>

<p>62:2. O God, my God, to thee do I watch at break of day. For thee my
soul hath thirsted; for thee my flesh, O how many ways!</p>

<p>62:3. In a desert land, and where there is no way, and no water: so in
the sanctuary have I come before thee, to see thy power and thy glory.</p>

<p>62:4. For thy mercy is better than lives: thee my lips will praise.</p>

<p>62:5. Thus will I bless thee all my life long: and in thy name I will
lift up my hands.</p>

<p>62:6. Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness: and my mouth
shall praise thee with joyful lips.</p>

<p>62:7. If I have remembered thee upon my bed, I will meditate on thee in
the morning:</p>

<p>62:8. Because thou hast been my helper. And I will rejoice under the
covert of thy wings:</p>

<p>62:9. My soul hath stuck close to thee: thy right hand hath received me.</p>

<p>62:10. But they have fought my soul in vain, they shall go into the
lower parts of the earth:</p>

<p>62:11. They shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall
be the portions of foxes.</p>

<p>62:12. But the king shall rejoice in God, all they shall be praised that
swear by him: because the mouth is stopped of them that speak wicked
things.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 63</p>

<p>Exaudi Deus orationem.</p>

<p>A prayer in affliction, with confidence in God that he will bring to
nought the machinations of persecutors.</p>

<p>63:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David.</p>

<p>63:2. Hear O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee: deliver
my soul from the fear of the enemy.</p>

<p>63:3. Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; from
the multitude of the workers of iniquity.</p>

<p>63:4. For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; they have bent
their bow a bitter thing,</p>

<p>63:5. To shoot in secret the undefiled.</p>

<p>63:6. They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear: they are
resolute in wickedness. They have talked of hiding snares; they have
said: Who shall see them?</p>

<p>63:7. They have searched after iniquities: they have failed in their
search. Man shall come to a deep heart:</p>

<p>A deep heart... That is, crafty, subtle, deep projects and designs;
which nevertheless shall not succeed; for God shall be exalted in
bringing them to nought by his wisdom and power.</p>

<p>63:8. And God shall be exalted. The arrows of children are their wounds:</p>

<p>The arrows of children are their wounds... That is, the wounds, stripes,
or blows, they seek to inflict upon the just, are but like the weak
efforts of children's arrows, which can do no execution: and their
tongues, that is, their speeches against them come to nothing.</p>

<p>63:9. And their tongues against them are made weak. All that saw them
were troubled;</p>

<p>63:10. And every man was afraid. And they declared the works of God, and
understood his doings.</p>

<p>63:11. The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: and
all the upright in heart shall be praised.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 64</p>

<p>Te decet.</p>

<p>God is to be praised in his church, to which all nations shall be
called.</p>

<p>
64:1. To the end, a psalm of David. The canticle of Jeremias and
Ezechiel to the people of the captivity, when they began to go out.</p>

<p>Of the captivity... That is, the people of the captivity of Babylon.
This is not in the Hebrew, but is found in the ancient translation of
the Septuagint.</p>

<p>64:2. A hymn, O God, becometh thee in Sion: and a vow shall be paid to
thee in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>64:3. O hear my prayer: all flesh shall come to thee.</p>

<p>64:4. The words of the wicked have prevailed over us: and thou wilt
pardon our transgressions.</p>

<p>64:5. Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and taken to thee: he shall
dwell in thy courts. We shall be filled with the good things of thy
house; holy is thy temple,</p>

<p>64:6. Wonderful in justice. Hear us, O God our saviour, who art the hope
of all the ends of the earth, and in the sea afar off.</p>

<p>64:7. Thou who preparest the mountains by thy strength, being girded
with power:</p>

<p>64:8. Who troublest the depth of the sea, the noise of its waves. The
Gentiles shall be troubled,</p>

<p>64:9. And they that dwell in the uttermost borders shall be afraid at
thy signs: thou shalt make the outgoings of the morning and of the
evening to be joyful.</p>

<p>64:10. Thou hast visited the earth, and hast plentifully watered it;
thou hast many ways enriched it. The river of God is filled with water,
thou hast prepared their food: for so is its preparation.</p>

<p>64:11. Fill up plentifully the streams thereof, multiply its fruits; it
shall spring up and rejoice in its showers.</p>

<p>64:12. Thou shalt bless the crown of the year of thy goodness: and thy
fields shall be filled with plenty.</p>

<p>64:13. The beautiful places of the wilderness shall grow fat: and the
hills shall be girded about with joy,</p>

<p>64:14. The rams of the flock are clothed, and the vales shall abound
with corn: they shall shout, yea they shall sing a hymn.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 65</p>

<p>Jubilate Deo.</p>

<p>An invitation to praise God.</p>

<p>65:1. Unto the end, a canticle of a psalm of the resurrection. Shout
with joy to God, all the earth,</p>

<p>65:2. Sing ye a psalm to his name; give glory to his praise.</p>

<p>65:3. Say unto God, How terrible are thy works, O Lord! in the multitude
of thy strength thy enemies shall lie to thee.</p>

<p>65:4. Let all the earth adore thee, and sing to thee: let it sing a
psalm to thy name.</p>

<p>65:5. Come and see the works of God; who is terrible in his counsels
over the sons of men.</p>

<p>65:6. Who turneth the sea into dry land, in the river they shall pass on
foot: there shall we rejoice in him.</p>

<p>65:7. Who by his power ruleth for ever: his eyes behold the nations; let
not them that provoke him be exalted in themselves.</p>

<p>65:8. O bless our God, ye Gentiles: and make the voice of his praise to
be heard.</p>

<p>65:9. Who hath set my soul to live: and hath not suffered my feet to be
moved:</p>

<p>65:10. For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us by fire, as
silver is tried.</p>

<p>65:11. Thou hast brought us into a net, thou hast laid afflictions on
our back:</p>

<p>65:12. Thou hast set men over our heads. We have passed through fire and
water, and thou hast brought us out into a refreshment.</p>

<p>65:13. I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my
vows,</p>

<p>65:14. Which my lips have uttered, And my mouth hath spoken, when I was
in trouble.</p>

<p>65:15. I will offer up to thee holocausts full of marrow, with burnt
offerings of rams: I will offer to thee bullocks with goats.</p>

<p>65:16. Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will tell you what
great things he hath done for my soul.</p>

<p>65:17. I cried to him with my mouth: and I extolled him with my tongue.</p>

<p>65:18. If I have looked at iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear
me.</p>

<p>65:19. Therefore hath God heard me, and hath attended to the voice of my
supplication.</p>

<p>65:20. Blessed be God, who hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy
from me.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 66</p>

<p>Deus misereatur.</p>

<p>A prayer for the propagation of the church.</p>

<p>66:1. Unto the end, in hymns, a psalm of a canticle for David.</p>

<p>66:2. May God have mercy on us, and bless us: may he cause the light of
his countenance to shine upon us, and may he have mercy on us.</p>

<p>66:3. That we may know thy way upon earth: thy salvation in all nations.</p>

<p>66:4. Let people confess to thee, O God: let all people give praise to
thee.</p>

<p>66:5. Let the nations be glad and rejoice: for thou judgest the people
with justice, and directest the nations upon earth.</p>

<p>66:6. Let the people, O God, confess to thee: let all the people give
praise to thee:</p>

<p>66:7. The earth hath yielded her fruit. May God, our God bless us,</p>

<p>66:8. May God bless us: and all the ends of the earth fear him.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 67</p>

<p>Exurgat Deus.</p>

<p>The glorious establishment of the church of the New Testament,
prefigured by the benefits bestowed on the people of Israel.</p>

<p>67:1. Unto the end, a psalm of a canticle for David himself.</p>

<p>67:2. Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: and let them that
hate him flee from before his face.</p>

<p>67:3. As smoke vanisheth, so let them vanish away: as wax melteth before
the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</p>

<p>67:4. And let the just feast, and rejoice before God: and be delighted
with gladness.</p>

<p>67:5. Sing ye to God, sing a psalm to his name, make a way for him who
ascendeth upon the west: the Lord is his name. Rejoice ye before him:
but the wicked shall be troubled at his presence,</p>

<p>Who ascendeth upon the west... Super occasum. St. Gregory understands it
of Christ, who after his going down, like the sun, in the west, by his
passion and death, ascended more glorious, and carried all before him.
St. Jerome renders it, who ascendeth, or cometh up, through the deserts.</p>

<p>67:6. Who is the father of orphans, and the judge of widows. God in his
holy place:</p>

<p>67:7. God who maketh men of one manner to dwell in a house: Who bringeth
out them that were bound in strength; in like manner them that provoke,
that dwell in sepulchres.</p>

<p>Of one manner... That is, agreeing in faith, unanimous in love, and
following the same manner of discipline. It is verified in the servants
of God, living together in his house, which is the church. 1 Tim. 3.15.
Ibid. Them that were bound, etc... The power and mercy of God appears in
his bringing out of their captivity those that were strongly bound in
their sins: and in restoring to his grace those whose behaviour had been
most provoking; and who by their evil habits were not only dead, but
buried in their sepulchres.</p>

<p>67:8. O God, when thou didst go forth in the sight of thy people, when
thou didst pass through the desert:</p>

<p>67:9. The earth was moved, and the heavens dropped at the presence of
the God of Sina, at the presence of the God of Israel.</p>

<p>67:10. Thou shalt set aside for thy inheritance a free rain, O God: and
it was weakened, but thou hast made it perfect.</p>

<p>A free rain... the manna, which rained plentifully from heaven, in
favour of God's inheritance, that is, of his people Israel: which was
weakened indeed under a variety of afflictions, but was made perfect by
God; that is, was still supported by divine providence, and brought on
to the promised land. It agrees particularly to the church of Christ his
true inheritance, which is plentifully watered with the free rain of
heavenly grace; and through many infirmities, that is, crosses and
tribulations, is made perfect, and fitted for eternal glory.</p>

<p>67:11. In it shall thy animals dwell; in thy sweetness, O God, thou hast
provided for the poor.</p>

<p>In it, etc... That is, in this church, which is thy fold and thy
inheritance, shall thy animals, thy sheep, dwell: where thou hast
plentifully provided for them.</p>

<p>67:12. The Lord shall give the word to them that preach good tidings
with great power.</p>

<p>To them that preach good tidings... Evangelizantibus. That is, to the
preachers of the gospel; who receiving the word from the Lord, shall
with great power and efficacy preach throughout the world the glad
tidings of a Saviour, and of eternal salvation through him.</p>

<p>67:13. The king of powers is of the beloved, of the beloved; and the
beauty of the house shall divide spoils.</p>

<p>The king of powers... That is, the mighty King, the Lord of hosts, is of
the beloved, of the beloved; that is, is on the side of Christ, his most
beloved son: and his beautiful house, viz., the church, in which God
dwells forever, shall by her spiritual conquests divide the spoils of
many nations. The Hebrew (as it now stands pointed) is thus rendered,
The kings of armies have fled, they have fled, and she that dwells at
home (or the beauty of the house) shall divide the spoils.</p>

<p>67:14. If you sleep among the midst of lots, you shall be as the wings
of a dove covered with silver, and the hinder parts of her back with the
paleness of gold.</p>

<p>If you sleep among the midst of lots (intermedios cleros, etc.)... Viz.,
in such dangers and persecutions, as if your enemies were casting lots
for your goods and persons: or in the midst of the lots, (intermedios
terminos, as St. Jerome renders it,) that is, upon the very bounds or
borders of the dominions of your enemies: you shall be secure
nevertheless under the divine protection; and shall be enabled to fly
away, like a dove, with glittering wings and feathers shining like the
palest and most precious gold; that is, with great increase of virtue,
and glowing with the fervour of charity.</p>

<p>67:15. When he that is in heaven appointeth kings over her, they shall
be whited with snow in Selmon.</p>

<p>Kings over her... That is, pastors and rulers over his church, viz., the
apostles and their successors. Then by their ministry shall men be made
whiter than the snow which lies on the top of the high mountain Selmon.</p>

<p>67:16. The mountain of God is a fat mountain. A curdled mountain, a fat
mountain.</p>

<p>The mountain of God... The church, which, Isa. 2.2, is called The
mountain of the house of the Lord upon the top of mountains. It is here
called a fat and a curdled mountain; that is to say, most fruitful, and
enriched by the spiritual gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>67:17. Why suspect, ye curdled mountains? A mountain in which God is
well pleased to dwell: for there the Lord shall dwell unto the end.</p>

<p>Why suspect, ye curdled mountains?... Why do you suppose or imagine
there may be any other such curdled mountains? You are mistaken: the
mountain thus favoured by God is but one; and this same he has chosen
for his dwelling for ever.</p>

<p>67:18. The chariot of God is attended by ten thousands; thousands of
them that rejoice: the Lord is among them in Sina, in the holy place.</p>

<p>The chariot of God... Descending to give his law on mount Sina: as also
of Jesus Christ his Son, ascending into heaven, to send from thence the
Holy Ghost, to publish his new law, is attended with ten thousands, that
is, with an innumerable multitude of joyful angels.</p>

<p>67:19. Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive; thou
hast received gifts in men. Yea for those also that do not believe, the
dwelling of the Lord God.</p>

<p>Led captivity captive... Carrying away with thee to heaven those who
before had been the captives of Satan; and receiving from God the Father
gifts to be distributed to men; even to those who were before
unbelievers.</p>

<p>67:20. Blessed be the Lord day by day: the God of our salvation will
make our journey prosperous to us.</p>

<p>67:21. Our God is the God of salvation: and of the Lord, of the Lord are
the issues from death.</p>

<p>The issues from death... The Lord alone is master of the issues, by
which we may escape from death.</p>

<p>67:22. But God shall break the heads of his enemies: the hairy crown of
them that walk on in their sins.</p>

<p>67:23. The Lord said: I will turn them from Basan, I will turn them into
the depth of the sea:</p>

<p>I will turn them from Basan, etc... I will cast out my enemies from
their rich possessions, signified by Basan, a fruitful country; and I
will drive them into the depth of the sea: and make such a slaughter of
them, that the feet of my servants may be dyed in their blood, etc.</p>

<p>67:24. That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thy enemies; the
tongue of thy dogs be red with the same.</p>

<p>67:25. They have seen thy goings, O God, the goings of my God: of my
king who is in his sanctuary.</p>

<p>Thy goings... Thy ways, thy proceedings, by which thou didst formerly
take possession of the promised land in favour of thy people; and shalt
afterwards of the whole world, which thou shalt subdue to thy Son.</p>

<p>67:26. Princes went before joined with singers, in the midst of young
damsels playing on timbrels.</p>

<p>Princes... The apostles, the first converters of nations; attended by
numbers of perfect souls, singing the divine praises, and virgins
consecrated to God.</p>

<p>67:27. In the churches bless ye God the Lord, from the fountains of
Israel.</p>

<p>From the fountains of Israel... From whom both Christ and his apostles
sprung. By Benjamin, the holy fathers on this place understand St. Paul,
who was of that tribe, named here a youth, because he was the last
called to the apostleship. By the princes of Juda, Zabulon, and
Nephthali, we may understand the other apostles, who were of the tribe
of Juda; or of the tribes of Zabulon, and Nephthali, where our Lord
began to preach, Matt. 4.13, etc.</p>

<p>67:28. There is Benjamin a youth, in ecstasy of mind. The princes of
Juda are their leaders: the princes of Zabulon, the princes of
Nephthali.</p>

<p>67:29. Command thy strength, O God confirm, O God, what thou hast
wrought in us.</p>

<p>Command thy strength.. Give orders that thy strength may be always with
us.</p>

<p>67:30. From thy temple in Jerusalem, kings shall offer presents to thee.</p>

<p>67:31. Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds, the congregation of bulls
with the kine of the people; who seek to exclude them who are tried with
silver. Scatter thou the nations that delight in wars:</p>

<p>Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds... or the wild beasts, which lie hid
in the reeds. That is, the devils, who hide themselves in order to
surprise their prey. Or by wild beasts, are here understood persecutors,
who, for all their attempts against the Church, are but as weak reeds,
which cannot prevail against them who are supported by the strength of
the Almighty. The same are also called the congregation of bulls (from
their rage against the Church) who assemble together all their kine,
that is, the people their subjects, to exclude if they can, from Christ
and his inheritance, his constant confessors, who are like silver tried
by fire.</p>

<p>67:32. Ambassadors shall come out of Egypt: Ethiopia shall soon stretch
out her hands to God.</p>

<p>Ambassadors shall come, etc... It is a prophecy of the conversion of the
Gentiles, and by name of the Egyptians and Ethiopians.</p>

<p>67:33. Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth: sing ye to the Lord: Sing
ye to God,</p>

<p>67:34. Who mounteth above the heaven of heavens, to the east. Behold he
will give to his voice the voice of power:</p>

<p>To the east... From mount Olivet, which is on the east side of
Jerusalem.-Ibid. The voice of power... That is, he will make his voice
to be a powerful voice: by calling from death to life, such as were dead
in mortal sin: as at the last day he will by the power of his voice call
all the dead from their graves.</p>

<p>67:35. Give ye glory to God for Israel, his magnificence, and his power
is in the clouds.</p>

<p>67:36. God is wonderful in his saints: the God of Israel is he who will
give power and strength to his people. Blessed be God.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 68</p>

<p>Salvum me fac, Deus.</p>

<p>Christ in his passion declareth the greatness of his sufferings, and the
malice of his persecutors the Jews; and foretelleth their reprobation.</p>

<p>68:1. Unto the end, for them that shall be changed; for David.</p>

<p>For them that shall be changed... A psalm for Christian converts, to
remember the passion of Christ.</p>

<p>68:2. Save me, O God: for the waters are come in even unto my soul.</p>

<p>The waters... Of afflictions and sorrows. My soul is sorrowful even unto
death. Matt. 26.38.</p>

<p>68:3. I stick fast in the mire of the deep and there is no sure
standing. I am come into the depth of the sea, and a tempest hath
overwhelmed me.</p>

<p>68:4. I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse, my eyes
have failed, whilst I hope in my God.</p>

<p>68:5. They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, who hate me
without cause. My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully
persecuted me: then did I pay that which I took not away.</p>

<p>I pay that which I took not away... Christ in his passion made
restitution of what he had not taken away, by suffering the punishment
due to our sins, and so repairing the injury we had done to God.</p>

<p>68:6. O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my offences are not hidden
from thee:</p>

<p>My foolishness and my offences... which my enemies impute to me: or the
follies and sins of men, which I have taken upon myself.</p>

<p>68:7. Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O Lord, the
Lord of hosts. Let them not be confounded on my account, who seek thee,
O God of Israel.</p>

<p>68:8. Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my
face.</p>

<p>68:9. I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to the sons of
my mother.</p>

<p>68:10. For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: and the reproaches of
them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</p>

<p>68:11. And I covered my soul in fasting: and it was made a reproach to
me.</p>

<p>68:12. And I made haircloth my garment: and I became a byword to them.</p>

<p>68:13. They that sat in the gate spoke against me: and they that drank
wine made me their song.</p>

<p>68:14. But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; for the time of thy
good pleasure, O God. In the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the
truth of thy salvation.</p>

<p>68:15. Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast: deliver me
from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</p>

<p>68:16. Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep water swallow
me up: and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</p>

<p>68:17. Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; look upon me according to
the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>

<p>68:18. And turn not away thy face from thy servant: for I am in trouble,
hear me speedily.</p>

<p>68:19. Attend to my soul, and deliver it: save me because of my enemies.</p>

<p>68:20. Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, and my shame.</p>

<p>68:21. In thy sight are all they that afflict me; my heart hath expected
reproach and misery. And I looked for one that would grieve together
with me, but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I
found none.</p>

<p>68:22. And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me
vinegar to drink.</p>

<p>68:23. Let their table become as a snare before them, and a recompense,
and a stumblingblock.</p>

<p>Let their table, etc... What here follows in the style of an
imprecation, is a prophecy of the wretched state to which the Jews
should be reduced in punishment of their wilful obstinacy.</p>

<p>68:24. Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; and their back bend
thou down always.</p>

<p>68:25. Pour out thy indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful anger
take hold of them.</p>

<p>68:26. Let their habitation be made desolate: and let there be none to
dwell in their tabernacles.</p>

<p>68:27. Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; and they
have added to the grief of my wounds.</p>

<p>68:28. Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: and let them not come into
thy justice.</p>

<p>68:29. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the
just let them not be written.</p>

<p>68:30. But I am poor and sorrowful: thy salvation, O God, hath set me
up.</p>

<p>68:31. I will praise the name of God with a canticle: and I will magnify
him with praise.</p>

<p>68:32. And it shall please God better than a young calf, that bringeth
forth horns and hoofs.</p>

<p>68:33. Let the poor see and rejoice: seek ye God, and your soul shall
live.</p>

<p>68:34. For the Lord hath heard the poor: and hath not despised his
prisoners.</p>

<p>68:35. Let the heavens and the earth praise him; the sea, and every
thing that creepeth therein.</p>

<p>68:36. For God will save Sion, and the cities of Juda shall be built up.
And they shall dwell there, and acquire it by inheritance.</p>

<p>Sion... The catholic church. The cities of Juda, etc., her places of
worship, which shall be established throughout the world. And there,
viz., in this church of Christ, shall his servants dwell, etc.</p>

<p>68:37. And the seed of his servants shall possess it; and they that love
his name shall dwell therein.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 69</p>

<p>Deus in adjutorium.</p>

<p>A prayer in persecution.</p>

<p>69:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David, to bring to remembrance that the
Lord saved him.</p>

<p>69:2. O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me.</p>

<p>69:3. Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek my soul:</p>

<p>69:4. Let them be turned backward, and blush for shame that desire evils
to me: Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that say to
me: 'Tis well, 'tis well.</p>

<p>'T is well, 't is well... Euge, euge. St. Jerome renders it, vah, vah!
which is the voice of one insulting and deriding. Some understand it as
a detestation of deceitful flatterers.</p>

<p>69:5. Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such
as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.</p>

<p>69:6. But I am needy and poor; O God, help me. Thou art my helper and my
deliverer: O lord, make no delay.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 70</p>

<p>In te, Domine.</p>

<p>A prayer for perseverance.</p>

<p>70:1. A psalm for David. Of the sons of Jonadab, and the former
captives. In thee, O Lord, I have hoped, let me never be put to
confusion:</p>

<p>Of the sons of Jonadab... The Rechabites, of whom see Jer. 35. By this
addition of the seventy-two interpreters, we gather that this psalm was
usually sung in the synagogue, in the person of the Rechabites, and of
those who were first carried away into captivity.</p>

<p>70:2. Deliver me in thy justice, and rescue me. Incline thy ear unto me,
and save me.</p>

<p>70:3. Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a place of strength: that
thou mayst make me safe. For thou art my firmament and my refuge.</p>

<p>70:4. Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the sinner, and out of
the hand of the transgressor of the law and of the unjust.</p>

<p>70:5. For thou art my patience, O Lord: my hope, O Lord, from my youth.</p>

<p>70:6. By thee have I been confirmed from the womb: from my mother's womb
thou art my protector. Of thee I shall continually sing:</p>

<p>70:7. I am become unto many as a wonder, but thou art a strong helper.</p>

<p>70:8. Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may sing thy glory; thy
greatness all the day long.</p>

<p>70:9. Cast me not off in the time of old age: when my strength shall
fail, do not thou forsake me.</p>

<p>70:10. For my enemies have spoken against me; and they that watched my
soul have consulted together,</p>

<p>70:11. Saying: God hath forsaken him: pursue and take him, for there is
none to deliver him.</p>

<p>70:12. O God, be not thou far from me: O my God, make haste to my help.</p>

<p>70:13. Let them be confounded and come to nothing that detract my soul;
let them be covered with confusion and blame that seek my hurt.</p>

<p>70:14. But I will always hope; and will add to all thy praise.</p>

<p>70:15. My mouth shall shew forth thy justice; thy salvation all the day
long. Because I have not known learning,</p>

<p>Learning... As much as to say, I build not upon human learning, but only
on the power and justice of God.</p>

<p>70:16. I will enter into the powers of the Lord: O Lord, I will be
mindful of thy justice alone.</p>

<p>70:17. Thou hast taught me, O God, from my youth: and till now I will
declare thy wonderful works.</p>

<p>70:18. And unto old age and grey hairs: O God, forsake me not, Until I
shew forth thy arm to all the generation that is to come: Thy power,</p>

<p>70:19. And thy justice, O God, even to the highest great things thou
hast done: O God, who is like to thee?</p>

<p>70:20. How great troubles hast thou shewn me, many and grievous: and
turning thou hast brought me to life, and hast brought me back again
from the depths of the earth:</p>

<p>70:21. Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence; and turning to me thou
hast comforted me.</p>

<p>70:22. For I will also confess to thee thy truth with the instruments of
psaltery: O God, I will sing to thee with the harp, thou holy one of
Israel.</p>

<p>70:23. My lips shall greatly rejoice, when I shall sing to thee; and my
soul which thou hast redeemed.</p>

<p>70:24. Yea and my tongue shall meditate on thy justice all the day; when
they shall be confounded and put to shame that seek evils to me.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 71</p>

<p>Deus, judicium tuum.</p>

<p>A prophecy of the coming of Christ, and of his kingdom: prefigured by
Solomon and his happy reign.</p>

<p>71:1. A psalm on Solomon.</p>

<p>71:2. Give to the king thy judgment, O God, and to the king's son thy
justice: To judge thy people with justice, and thy poor with judgment.</p>

<p>71:3. Let the mountains receive peace for the people: and the hills
justice.</p>

<p>71:4. He shall judge the poor of the people, and he shall save the
children of the poor: and he shall humble the oppressor.</p>

<p>71:5. And he shall continue with the sun and before the moon, throughout
all generations.</p>

<p>71:6. He shall come down like rain upon the fleece; and as showers
falling gently upon the earth.</p>

<p>71:7. In his days shall justice spring up, and abundance of peace, till
the moon be taken away.</p>

<p>71:8. And he shall rule from sea to sea, and from the river unto the
ends of the earth.</p>

<p>71:9. Before him the Ethiopians shall fall down: and his enemies shall
lick the ground.</p>

<p>71:10. The kings of Tharsis and the islands shall offer presents: the
kings of the Arabians and of Saba shall bring gifts:</p>

<p>71:11. And all kings of the earth shall adore him: all nations shall
serve him.</p>

<p>71:12. For he shall deliver the poor from the mighty: and the needy that
had no helper.</p>

<p>71:13. He shall spare the poor and needy: and he shall save the souls of
the poor.</p>

<p>71:14. He shall redeem their souls from usuries and iniquity: and their
names shall be honourable in his sight.</p>

<p>71:15. And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
Arabia, for him they shall always adore: they shall bless him all the
day.</p>

<p>71:16. And there shall be a firmament on the earth on the tops of
mountains, above Libanus shall the fruit thereof be exalted: and they of
the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth.</p>

<p>A firmament on the earth, etc... This may be understood of the church of
Christ, ever firm and visible: and of the flourishing condition of its
congregation.</p>

<p>71:17. Let his name be blessed for evermore: his name continueth before
the sun. And in him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed: all
nations shall magnify him.</p>

<p>71:18. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who alone doth wonderful
things.</p>

<p>71:19. And blessed be the name of his majesty for ever: and the whole
earth shall be filled with his majesty. So be it. So be it.</p>

<p>71:20. The praises of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.</p>

<p>Are ended... By this it appears that this psalm, though placed here, was
in order of time the last of those which David composed.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 72</p>

<p>Quam bonus Israel Deus.</p>

<p>The temptation of the weak, upon seeing the prosperity of the wicked, is
overcome by the consideration of the justice of God, who will quickly
render to every one according to his works.</p>

<p>72:1. A psalm for Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to them that are of
a right heart!</p>

<p>72:2. But my feet were almost moved; my steps had well nigh slipped.</p>

<p>72:3. Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing the
prosperity of sinners.</p>

<p>72:4. For there is no regard to their death, nor is there strength in
their stripes.</p>

<p>72:5. They are not in the labour of men: neither shall they be scourged
like other men.</p>

<p>72:6. Therefore pride hath held them fast: they are covered with their
iniquity and their wickedness.</p>

<p>72:7. Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness: they have
passed into the affection of the heart.</p>

<p>Fatness... Abundance and temporal prosperity, which hath encouraged them
in their iniquity: and made them give themselves up to their irregular
affections.</p>

<p>72:8. They have thought and spoken wickedness: they have spoken iniquity
on high.</p>

<p>72:9. They have set their mouth against heaven: and their tongue hath
passed through the earth.</p>

<p>72:10. Therefore will my people return here and full days shall be found
in them.</p>

<p>Return here... or hither. The weak among the servants of God, will be
apt often to return to this thought, and will be shocked when they
consider the full days, that is, the long and prosperous life of the
wicked; and will be tempted to make the reflections against providence
which are set down in the following verses.</p>

<p>72:11. And they said: How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the
most High?</p>

<p>72:12. Behold these are sinners; and yet, abounding in the world they
have obtained riches.</p>

<p>72:13. And I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart, and washed my
hands among the innocent.</p>

<p>72:14. And I have been scourged all the day; and my chastisement hath
been in the mornings.</p>

<p>72:15. If I said: I will speak thus; behold I should condemn the
generation of thy children.</p>

<p>If I said, etc... That is, if I should indulge such thoughts as these.</p>

<p>72:16. I studied that I might know this thing, it is a labour in my
sight:</p>

<p>72:17. Until I go into the sanctuary of God, and understand concerning
their last ends.</p>

<p>72:18. But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them: when they were
lifted up thou hast cast them down.</p>

<p>Thou hast put it to them... In punishment of their deceits, or for
deceiving them, thou hast brought evils upon them in their last end,
which, in their prosperity they never apprehended.</p>

<p>72:19. How are they brought to desolation? they have suddenly ceased to
be: they have perished by reason of their iniquity.</p>

<p>72:20. As the dream of them that awake, O Lord; so in thy city thou
shalt bring their image to nothing.</p>

<p>72:21. For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed:</p>

<p>72:22. And I am brought to nothing, and I knew not.</p>

<p>72:23. I am become as a beast before thee: and I am always with thee.</p>

<p>72:24. Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast
conducted me, and with thy glory thou hast received me.</p>

<p>72:25. For what have I in heaven? and besides thee what do I desire upon
earth?</p>

<p>72:26. For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away: thou art the
God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever.</p>

<p>72:27. For behold they that go far from thee shall perish: thou hast
destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.</p>

<p>72:28. But it is good for me to adhere to my God, to put my hope in the
Lord God: That I may declare all thy praises, in the gates of the
daughter of Sion.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 73</p>

<p>Ut quid, Deus.</p>

<p>A prayer of the church under grievous persecutions.</p>

<p>73:1. Understanding for Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off unto the
end: why is thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture?</p>

<p>73:2. Remember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed from the
beginning. The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed:
mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt.</p>

<p>73:3. Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; see what
things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</p>

<p>73:4. And they that hate thee have made their boasts, in the midst of
thy solemnity. They have set up their ensigns for signs,</p>

<p>Their ensigns, etc... They have fixed their colours for signs and
trophies, both on the gates, and on the highest top of the temple: and
they knew not, that is, they regarded not the sanctity of the place.
This psalm manifestly foretells the time of the Machabees, and the
profanation of the temple by Antiochus.</p>

<p>73:5. And they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top. As
with axes in a wood of trees,</p>

<p>73:6. They have cut down at once the gates thereof, with axe and hatchet
they have brought it down.</p>

<p>73:7. They have set fire to thy sanctuary: they have defiled the
dwelling place of thy name on the earth.</p>

<p>73:8. They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: Let
us abolish all the festival days of God from the land.</p>

<p>73:9. Our signs we have not seen, there is now no prophet: and he will
know us no more.</p>

<p>73:10. How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach: is the adversary to
provoke thy name for ever?</p>

<p>73:11. Why dost thou turn away thy hand: and thy right hand out of the
midst of thy bosom for ever?</p>

<p>73:12. But God is our king before ages: he hath wrought salvation in the
midst of the earth.</p>

<p>73:13. Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm: thou didst crush
the heads of the dragons in the waters.</p>

<p>The sea firm... By making the waters of the Red Sea stand like firm
walls, whilst Israel passed through: and destroying the Egyptians called
here dragons from their cruelty, in the same waters, with their king:
casting up their bodies on the shore to be stripped by the Ethiopians
inhabiting in those days the coast of Arabia.</p>

<p>73:14. Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon: thou hast given him to
be meat for the people of the Ethiopians.</p>

<p>73:15. Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents: thou hast
dried up the Ethan rivers.</p>

<p>Ethan rivers... That is, rivers which run with strong streams. This was
verified in Jordan, Jos. 3, and in Arnon, Num. 21.14.</p>

<p>73:16. Thine is the day, and thine is the night: thou hast made the
morning light and the sun.</p>

<p>73:17. Thou hast made all the borders of the earth: the summer and the
spring were formed by thee.</p>

<p>73:18. Remember this, the enemy hath reproached the Lord: and a foolish
people hath provoked thy name.</p>

<p>73:19. Deliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee: and
forget not to the end the souls of thy poor.</p>

<p>73:20. Have regard to thy covenant: for they that are the obscure of the
earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity.</p>

<p>The obscure of the earth... Mean and ignoble wretches have been filled,
that is, enriched, with houses of iniquity, that is, with our estates
and possessions, which they have unjustly acquired.</p>

<p>73:21. Let not the humble be turned away with confusion: the poor and
needy shall praise thy name.</p>

<p>73:22. Arise, O God, judge thy own cause: remember thy reproaches with
which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day.</p>

<p>73:23. Forget not the voices of thy enemies: the pride of them that hate
thee ascendeth continually.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 74</p>

<p>Confitebimur tibi.</p>

<p>There is a just judgment to come: therefore let the wicked take care.</p>

<p>74:1. Unto the end, corrupt not, a psalm of a canticle for Asaph.</p>

<p>Corrupt not... It is believed to have been the beginning of some ode or
hymn, to the tune of which this psalm was to be sung. St. Augustine and
other fathers take it to be an admonition of the spirit of God, not to
faint or fail in our hope: but to persevere with constancy in good:
because God will not fail in his due time to render to every man
according to his works.</p>

<p>74:2. We will praise thee, O God: we will praise, and we will call upon
thy name. We will relate thy wondrous works:</p>

<p>74:3. When I shall take a time, I will judge justices.</p>

<p>When I shall take a time... In proper times: particularly at the last
day, when the earth shall melt away at the presence of the great Judge:
the same who originally laid the foundations of it, and as it were
established its pillars.</p>

<p>74:4. The earth is melted, and all that dwell therein: I have
established the pillars thereof.</p>

<p>74:5. I said to the wicked: Do not act wickedly: and to the sinners:
Lift not up the horn.</p>

<p>74:6. Lift not up your horn on high: speak not iniquity against God.</p>

<p>74:7. For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert
hills:</p>

<p>74:8. For God is the judge. One he putteth down, and another he lifteth
up:</p>

<p>74:9. For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of
mixture. And he hath poured it out from this to that: but the dregs
thereof are not emptied: all the sinners of the earth shall drink.</p>

<p>74:10. But I will declare for ever: I will sing to the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>74:11. And I will break all the horns of sinners: but the horns of the
just shall be exalted.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 75</p>

<p>Notus in Judaea.</p>

<p>God is known in his church: and exerts his power in protecting it. It
alludes to the slaughter of the Assyrians, in the days of king Ezechias.</p>

<p>75:1. Unto the end, in praises, a psalm for Asaph: a canticle to the
Assyrians.</p>

<p>75:2. In Judea God is known: his name is great in Israel.</p>

<p>75:3. And his place is in peace: and his abode in Sion:</p>

<p>75:4. There hath he broken the powers of bows, the shield, the sword,
and the battle.</p>

<p>75:5. Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills.</p>

<p>75:6. All the foolish of heart were troubled. They have slept their
sleep; and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.</p>

<p>75:7. At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that
mounted on horseback.</p>

<p>75:8. Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? from that time thy
wrath.</p>

<p>From that time, etc... From the time that thy wrath shall break out.</p>

<p>75:9. Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven: the earth
trembled and was still,</p>

<p>75:10. When God arose in judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.</p>

<p>75:11. For the thought of man shall give praise to thee: and the
remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee.</p>

<p>75:12. Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your God: all you that are round
about him bring presents. To him that is terrible,</p>

<p>75:13. Even to him who taketh away the spirit of princes: to the
terrible with the kings of the earth.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 76</p>

<p>Voce mea.</p>

<p>The faithful have recourse to God in trouble of mind, with confidence in
his mercy and power.</p>

<p>76:1. Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph.</p>

<p>76:2. I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice, and he
gave ear to me.</p>

<p>76:3. In the days of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to
him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be
comforted:</p>

<p>76:4. I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my
spirit swooned away.</p>

<p>76:5. My eyes prevented the watches: I was troubled, and I spoke not.</p>

<p>76:6. I thought upon the days of old: and I had in my mind the eternal
years.</p>

<p>76:7. And I meditated in the night with my own heart: and I was
exercised and I swept my spirit.</p>

<p>76:8. Will God then cast off for ever? or will he never be more
favourable again?</p>

<p>76:9. Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to
generation?</p>

<p>76:10. Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will he in his anger shut up
his mercies?</p>

<p>76:11. And I said, Now have I begun: this is the change of the right
hand of the most High.</p>

<p>76:12. I remembered the works of the Lord: for I will be mindful of thy
wonders from the beginning.</p>

<p>76:13. And I will meditate on all thy works: and will be employed in thy
inventions.</p>

<p>76:14. Thy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great God like
our God?</p>

<p>76:15. Thou art the God that dost wonders. Thou hast made thy power
known among the nations:</p>

<p>76:16. With thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob
and of Joseph.</p>

<p>76:17. The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: and they were
afraid, and the depths were troubled.</p>

<p>76:18. Great was the noise of the waters: the clouds sent out a sound.
For thy arrows pass:</p>

<p>76:19. The voice of thy thunder in a wheel. Thy lightnings enlightened
the world: the earth shook and trembled.</p>

<p>76:20. Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: and thy
footsteps shall not be known.</p>

<p>76:21. Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses
and Aaron.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 77</p>

<p>Attendite.</p>

<p>God's great benefits to the people of Israel, notwithstanding their
ingratitude.</p>

<p>77:1. Understanding for Asaph. Attend, O my people, to my law: incline
your ears to the words of my mouth.</p>

<p>77:2. I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter propositions from
the beginning.</p>

<p>Propositions... Deep and mysterious sayings. By this it appears that the
historical facts of ancient times, commemorated in this psalm, were deep
and mysterious: as being figures of great truths appertaining to the
time of the New Testament.</p>

<p>77:3. How great things have we heard and known, and our fathers have
told us.</p>

<p>77:4. They have not been hidden from their children, in another
generation. Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, and his
wonders which he hath done.</p>

<p>77:5. And he set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel. How
great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same
known to their children:</p>

<p>77:6. That another generation might know them. The children that should
be born and should rise up, and declare them to their children.</p>

<p>77:7. That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works
of God: and may seek his commandments.</p>

<p>77:8. That they may not become like their fathers, a perverse and
exasperating generation. A generation that set not their heart aright:
and whose spirit was not faithful to God.</p>

<p>77:9. The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they have
turned back in the day of battle.</p>

<p>77:10. They kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they would not
walk.</p>

<p>77:11. And they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had shewn
them.</p>

<p>77:12. Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the
land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.</p>

<p>77:13. He divided the sea and brought them through: and he made the
waters to stand as in a vessel.</p>

<p>77:14. And he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the night with
a light of fire.</p>

<p>77:15. He struck the rock in the wilderness: and gave them to drink, as
out of the great deep.</p>

<p>77:16. He brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams run down
as rivers.</p>

<p>77:17. And they added yet more sin against him: they provoked the most
High to wrath in the place without water.</p>

<p>77:18. And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their
desires.</p>

<p>77:19. And they spoke ill of God: they said: Can God furnish a table in
the wilderness?</p>

<p>77:20. Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the
streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his
people?</p>

<p>77:21. Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: and a fire was kindled
against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.</p>

<p>77:22. Because they believed not in God: and trusted not in his
salvation.</p>

<p>77:23. And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the
doors of heaven.</p>

<p>77:24. And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
the bread of heaven.</p>

<p>77:25. Man ate the bread of angels: he sent them provisions in
abundance.</p>

<p>77:26. He removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power brought
in the southwest wind.</p>

<p>77:27. And he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered fowls like
as the sand of the sea.</p>

<p>77:28. And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their
pavilions.</p>

<p>77:29. So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them
their desire:</p>

<p>77:30. they were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their
meat was in their mouth:</p>

<p>77:31. And the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones
amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of Israel.</p>

<p>77:32. In all these things they sinned still: and they behaved not for
his wondrous works.</p>

<p>77:33. And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste.</p>

<p>77:34. When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and
came to him early in the morning.</p>

<p>77:35. And they remembered that God was their helper: and the most high
God their redeemer.</p>

<p>77:36. And they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they
lied unto him:</p>

<p>77:37. But their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted
faithful in his covenant.</p>

<p>77:38. But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will not
destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and did not
kindle all his wrath.</p>

<p>77:39. And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and
returneth not.</p>

<p>77:40. How often did they provoke him in the desert: and move him to
wrath in the place without water?</p>

<p>77:41. And they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the holy one of
Israel.</p>

<p>77:42. They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them
from the hand of him that afflicted them:</p>

<p>77:43. How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field
of Tanis.</p>

<p>77:44. And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that
they might not drink.</p>

<p>77:45. He sent amongst them divers sorts of flies, which devoured them:
and frogs which destroyed them.</p>

<p>77:46. And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to
the locust.</p>

<p>77:47. And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry
trees with hoarfrost.</p>

<p>77:48. And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the
fire.</p>

<p>77:49. And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation
and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.</p>

<p>77:50. He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls
from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.</p>

<p>77:51. And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the
firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.</p>

<p>77:52. And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the
wilderness like a flock.</p>

<p>77:53. And he brought them out in hope and they feared not: and the sea
overwhelmed their enemies.</p>

<p>77:54. And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the
mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the
Gentiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of
distribution.</p>

<p>77:55. And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.</p>

<p>77:56. Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and they kept
not his testimonies.</p>

<p>77:57. And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their
fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.</p>

<p>77:58. They provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him to
jealousy with their graven things.</p>

<p>77:59. God heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel exceedingly
as it were to nothing.</p>

<p>77:60. And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle where he
dwelt among men.</p>

<p>77:61. And he delivered their strength into captivity: and their beauty
into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>77:62. And he shut up his people under the sword: and he despised his
inheritance.</p>

<p>77:63. Fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not
lamented.</p>

<p>77:64. Their priests fell by the sword: and their widows did not mourn.</p>

<p>77:65. And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty
man that hath been surfeited with wine.</p>

<p>77:66. And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them to an
everlasting reproach.</p>

<p>77:67. And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe
of Ephraim:</p>

<p>77:68. But he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he loved.</p>

<p>77:69. And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land which he
founded for ever.</p>

<p>As of unicorns... That is, firm and strong like the horn of the unicorn.
This is one of the chiefest of the propositions of this psalm,
foreshewing the firm establishment of the one, true, and everlasting
sanctuary of God, in his church.</p>

<p>77:70. And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of
sheep: he brought him from following the ewes great with young,</p>

<p>77:71. To feed Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance.</p>

<p>77:72. And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: and conducted them
by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 78</p>

<p>Deus, venerunt gentes.</p>

<p>The church in time of persecution prayeth for relief. It seems to belong
to the time of the Machabees.</p>

<p>78:1. A psalm for Asaph. O God, the heathens are come into thy
inheritance, they have defiled thy holy temple: they have made Jerusalem
as a place to keep fruit.</p>

<p>78:2. They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the
fowls of the air: the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth.</p>

<p>78:3. They have poured out their blood as water, round about Jerusalem
and there was none to bury them.</p>

<p>78:4. We are become a reproach to our neighbours: a scorn and derision
to them that are round about us.</p>

<p>78:5. How long, O Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever: shall thy zeal be
kindled like a fire?</p>

<p>78:6. Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee: and
upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.</p>

<p>78:7. Because they have devoured Jacob; and have laid waste his place.</p>

<p>78:8. Remember not our former iniquities: let thy mercies speedily
prevent us, for we are become exceeding poor.</p>

<p>78:9. Help us, O God, our saviour: and for the glory of thy name, O
Lord, deliver us: and forgive us our sins for thy name's sake:</p>

<p>78:10. Lest they should say among the Gentiles: Where is their God? And
let him be made known among the nations before our eyes, By the
revenging the blood of thy servants, which hath been shed:</p>

<p>78:11. Let the sighing of the prisoners come in before thee. According
to the greatness of thy arm, take possession of the children of them
that have been put to death.</p>

<p>78:12. And render to our neighbours sevenfold in their bosom: the
reproach wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</p>

<p>78:13. But we thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture, will give thanks
to thee for ever. We will shew forth thy praise, unto generation and
generation.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 79</p>

<p>Qui regis Israel.</p>

<p>A prayer for the church in tribulation, commemorating God's former
favours.</p>

<p>79:1. Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, a testimony for
Asaph, a psalm.</p>

<p>79:2. Give ear, O thou that rulest Israel: thou that leadest Joseph like
a sheep. Thou that sittest upon the cherubims, shine forth</p>

<p>79:3. Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses. Stir up thy might, and
come to save us.</p>

<p>79:4. Convert us, O God: and shew us thy face, and we shall be saved.</p>

<p>79:5. O Lord God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
prayer of thy servant?</p>

<p>79:6. How long wilt thou feed us with the bread of tears: and give us
for our drink tears in measure?</p>

<p>79:7. Thou hast made us to be a contradiction to our neighbours: and our
enemies have scoffed at us.</p>

<p>79:8. O God of hosts, convert us: and shew thy face, and we shall be
saved.</p>

<p>79:9. Thou hast brought a vineyard out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
Gentiles and planted it.</p>

<p>79:10. Thou wast the guide of its journey in its sight: thou plantedst
the roots thereof, and it filled the land.</p>

<p>79:11. The shadow of it covered the hills: and the branches thereof the
cedars of God.</p>

<p>79:12. It stretched forth its branches unto the sea, and its boughs unto
the river.</p>

<p>79:13. Why hast thou broken down the hedge thereof, so that all they who
pass by the way do pluck it?</p>

<p>79:14. The boar out of the wood hath laid it waste: and a singular wild
beast hath devoured it.</p>

<p>79:15. Turn again, O God of hosts, look down from heaven, and see, and
visit this vineyard:</p>

<p>79:16. And perfect the same which thy right hand hath planted: and upon
the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.</p>

<p>79:17. Things set on fire and dug down shall perish at the rebuke of thy
countenance.</p>

<p>Things set on fire, etc... So this vineyard of thine, almost consumed
already, must perish, if thou continue thy rebukes.</p>

<p>79:18. Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son
of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.</p>

<p>The man of thy right hand... Christ.</p>

<p>79:19. And we depart not from thee, thou shalt quicken us: and we will
call upon thy name.</p>

<p>79:20. O Lord God of hosts, convert us and shew thy face, and we shall
be saved.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 80</p>

<p>Exultate Deo.</p>

<p>An invitation to a solemn praising of God.</p>

<p>80:1. Unto the end, for the winepresses, a psalm for Asaph himself.</p>

<p>For the winepresses, etc... Torcularibus. It either signifies a musical
instrument, or that this psalm was to be sung at the feast of the
tabernacles after the gathering in of the vintage.</p>

<p>80:2. Rejoice to God our helper: sing aloud to the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>80:3. Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel: the pleasant psaltery
with the harp.</p>

<p>80:4. Blow up the trumpet on the new moon, on the noted day of your
solemnity.</p>

<p>80:5. For it is a commandment in Israel, and a judgment to the God of
Jacob.</p>

<p>80:6. He ordained it for a testimony in Joseph, when he came out of the
land of Egypt: he heard a tongue which he knew not.</p>

<p>80:7. He removed his back from the burdens: his hands had served in
baskets.</p>

<p>80:8. Thou calledst upon me in affliction, and I delivered thee: I heard
thee in the secret place of tempest: I proved thee at the waters of
contradiction.</p>

<p>In the secret place of tempest... Heb., Of thunder. When thou soughtest
to hide thyself from the tempest: or, when I came down to mount Sina,
hidden from thy eyes in a storm of thunder.</p>

<p>80:9. Hear, O my people, and I will testify to thee: O Israel, if thou
wilt hearken to me, &nbsp;&nbsp;10 &nbsp;there shall be no new god in thee: neither
shalt thou adore a strange god.</p>

<p>80:11. For I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of
Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</p>

<p>80:12. But my people heard not my voice: and Israel hearkened not to me.</p>

<p>80:13. So I let them go according to the desires of their heart: they
shall walk in their own inventions.</p>

<p>80:14. If my people had heard me: if Israel had walked in my ways:</p>

<p>80:15. I should soon have humbled their enemies, and laid my hand on
them that troubled them.</p>

<p>80:16. The enemies of the Lord have lied to him: and their time shall be
for ever.</p>

<p>Their time shall be forever... Impenitent sinners shall suffer for ever.</p>

<p>80:17. And he fed them with the fat of wheat, and filled them with honey
out of the rock.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 81</p>

<p>Deus stetit.</p>

<p>An exhortation to judges and men in power.</p>

<p>81:1. A psalm for Asaph. God hath stood in the congregation of gods: and
being in the midst of them he judgeth gods.</p>

<p>81:2. How long will you judge unjustly: and accept the persons of the
wicked?</p>

<p>81:3. Judge for the needy and fatherless: do justice to the humble and
the poor.</p>

<p>81:4. Rescue the poor; and deliver the needy out of the hand of the
sinner.</p>

<p>81:5. They have not known nor understood: they walk on in darkness: all
the foundations of the earth shall be moved.</p>

<p>81:6. I have said: You are gods and all of you the sons of the most
High.</p>

<p>81:7. But you like men shall die: and shall fall like one of the
princes.</p>

<p>81:8. Arise, O God, judge thou the earth: for thou shalt inherit among
all the nations.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 82</p>

<p>Deus, quis similis.</p>

<p>A prayer against the enemies of God's church.</p>

<p>82:1. A canticle of a psalm for Asaph.</p>

<p>82:2. O God, who shall be like to thee? hold not thy peace, neither be
thou still, O God.</p>

<p>82:3. For lo, thy enemies have made a noise: and they that hate thee
have lifted up the head.</p>

<p>82:4. They have taken a malicious counsel against thy people, and have
consulted against thy saints.</p>

<p>82:5. They have said: Come and let us destroy them, so that they be not
a nation: and let the name of Israel be remembered no more.</p>

<p>82:6. For they have contrived with one consent: they have made a
covenant together against thee,</p>

<p>82:7. The tabernacle of the Edomites, and the Ishmahelites: Moab, and
the Agarens,</p>

<p>82:8. Gebal, and Ammon and Amalec: the Philistines, with the inhabitants
of Tyre.</p>

<p>82:9. Yea, and the Assyrian also is joined with them: they are come to
the aid of the sons of Lot.</p>

<p>82:10. Do to them as thou didst to Madian and to Sisara: as to Jabin at
the brook of Cisson.</p>

<p>82:11. Who perished at Endor: and became as dung for the earth.</p>

<p>82:12. Make their princes like Oreb, and Zeb, and Zebee, and Salmana.
All their princes,</p>

<p>82:13. Who have said: Let us possess the sanctuary of God for an
inheritance.</p>

<p>82:14. O my God, make them like a wheel; and as stubble before the wind.</p>

<p>82:15. As fire which burneth the wood: and as a flame burning mountains:</p>

<p>82:16. So shalt thou pursue them with thy tempest: and shalt trouble
them in thy wrath.</p>

<p>82:17. Fill their faces with shame; and they shall seek thy name, O
Lord.</p>

<p>82:18. Let them be ashamed and troubled for ever and ever: and let them
be confounded and perish.</p>

<p>82:19. And let them know that the Lord is thy name: thou alone art the
most High over all the earth.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 83</p>

<p>Quam dilecta.</p>

<p>The soul aspireth after heaven; rejoicing in the mean time, in being in
the communion of God's church upon earth.</p>

<p>83:1. Unto the end, for the winepresses, a psalm for the sons of Core.</p>

<p>83:2. How lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!</p>

<p>83:3. my soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord. My heart
and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.</p>

<p>83:4. For the sparrow hath found herself a house, and the turtle a nest
for herself where she may lay her young ones: Thy altars, O Lord of
hosts, my king and my God.</p>

<p>83:5. Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, O Lord: they shall
praise thee for ever and ever.</p>

<p>83:6. Blessed is the man whose help is from thee: in his heart he hath
disposed to ascend by steps,</p>

<p>In his heart he hath disposed to ascend by steps, etc... Ascensiones in
corde suo disposuit. As by steps men ascended to the temple of God
situated on a hill; so the good Christian ascends towards the eternal
temple by certain steps of virtue disposed or ordered within the heart:
and this whilst he lives as yet in the body, in this vale of tears, the
place which man hath set: that is, which he hath brought himself to:
being cast out of paradise for his sin.</p>

<p>83:7. In the vale of tears, in the place which he hath set.</p>

<p>83:8. For the lawgiver shall give a blessing, they shall go from virtue
to virtue: the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.</p>

<p>83:9. O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.</p>

<p>83:10. Behold, O God our protector: and look on the face of thy Christ.</p>

<p>83:11. For better is one day in thy courts above thousands. I have
chosen to be an abject in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in
the tabernacles of sinners.</p>

<p>83:12. For God loveth mercy and truth: the Lord will give grace and
glory.</p>

<p>83:13. He will not deprive of good things them that walk in innocence: O
Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 84</p>

<p>Benedixisti, Domine.</p>

<p>The coming of Christ, to bring peace and salvation to man.</p>

<p>84:1. Unto the end, for the sons of Core, a psalm.</p>

<p>84:2. Lord, thou hast blessed thy land: thou hast turned away the
captivity of Jacob.</p>

<p>84:3. Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people: thou hast covered
all their sins.</p>

<p>84:4. Thou hast mitigated all thy anger: thou hast turned away from the
wrath of thy indignation.</p>

<p>84:5. Convert us, O God our saviour: and turn off thy anger from us.</p>

<p>84:6. Wilt thou be angry with us for ever: or wilt thou extend thy wrath
from generation to generation?</p>

<p>84:7. Thou wilt turn, O God, and bring us to life: and thy people shall
rejoice in thee.</p>

<p>84:8. Shew us, O Lord, thy mercy; and grant us thy salvation.</p>

<p>84:9. I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me: for he will speak
peace unto his people: And unto his saints: and unto them that are
converted to the heart.</p>

<p>84:10. Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him: that glory
may dwell in our land.</p>

<p>84:11. Mercy and truth have met each other: justice and peace have
kissed.</p>

<p>84:12. Truth is sprung out of the earth: and justice hath looked down
from heaven.</p>

<p>84:13. For the Lord will give goodness: and our earth shall yield her
fruit.</p>

<p>84:14. Justice shall walk before him: and shall set his steps in the
way.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 85</p>

<p>Inclina, Domine.</p>

<p>A prayer for God's grace to assist us to the end.</p>

<p>85:1. A prayer for David himself. Incline thy ear, O Lord, and hear me:
for I am needy and poor.</p>

<p>85:2. Preserve my soul, for I am holy: save thy servant, O my God, that
trusteth in thee.</p>

<p>I am holy... I am by my office and profession dedicated to thy service.</p>

<p>85:3. Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I have cried to thee all the day.</p>

<p>85:4. Give joy to the soul of thy servant, for to thee, O Lord, I have
lifted up my soul.</p>

<p>85:5. For thou, O Lord, art sweet and mild: and plenteous in mercy to
all that call upon thee.</p>

<p>85:6. Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer: and attend to the voice of my
petition.</p>

<p>85:7. I have called upon thee in the day of my trouble: because thou
hast heard me.</p>

<p>85:8. There is none among the gods like unto thee, O Lord: and there is
none according to thy works.</p>

<p>85:9. All the nations thou hast made shall come and adore before thee, O
Lord: and they shall glorify thy name.</p>

<p>85:10. For thou art great and dost wonderful things: thou art God alone.</p>

<p>85:11. Conduct me, O Lord, in thy way, and I will walk in thy truth: let
my heart rejoice that it may fear thy name.</p>

<p>85:12. I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I
will glorify thy name for ever:</p>

<p>85:13. For thy mercy is great towards me: and thou hast delivered my
soul out of the lower hell.</p>

<p>85:14. O God, the wicked are risen up against me, and the assembly of
the mighty have sought my soul: and they have not set thee before their
eyes.</p>

<p>85:15. And thou, O Lord, art a God of compassion, and merciful, patient,
and of much mercy, and true.</p>

<p>85:16. O look upon me, and have mercy on me: give thy command to thy
servant, and save the son of thy handmaid.</p>

<p>85:17. Shew me a token for good: that they who hate me may see, and be
confounded, because thou, O Lord, hast helped me and hast comforted me.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 86</p>

<p>Fundamenta ejus.</p>

<p>The glory of the church of Christ.</p>

<p>86:1. For the sons of Core, a psalm of a canticle. The foundations
thereof are the holy mountains:</p>

<p>The holy mountains... The apostles and prophets. Eph. 2.20.</p>

<p>86:2. The Lord loveth the gates of Sion above all the tabernacles of
Jacob.</p>

<p>86:3. Glorious things are said of thee, O city of God.</p>

<p>86:4. I will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon knowing me. Behold the
foreigners, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians, these were
there.</p>

<p>Rahab... Egypt, etc. To this Sion, which is the church of God, many
shall resort from all nations.</p>

<p>86:5. Shall not Sion say: This man and that man is born in her? &nbsp;and the
Highest himself hath founded her.</p>

<p>Shall not Sion say, etc... The meaning is, that Sion, viz., the church,
shall not only be able to commemorate this or that particular person of
renown born in her, but also to glory in great multitudes of people and
princes of her communion; who have been foretold in the writings of the
prophets, and registered in the writings of the apostles.</p>

<p>86:6. The Lord shall tell in his writings of peoples and of princes, of
them that have been in her.</p>

<p>86:7. The dwelling in thee is as it were of all rejoicing.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 87</p>

<p>Domine, Deus salutis.</p>

<p>A prayer of one under grievous affliction: it agrees to Christ in his
passion, and alludes to his death and burial.</p>

<p>87:1. A canticle of a psalm for the sons of Core: unto the end, for
Maheleth, to answer understanding of Eman the Ezrahite.</p>

<p>Maheleth... A musical instrument, or chorus of musicians, to answer one
another.-Ibid. Understanding... Or a psalm of instruction, composed by
Eman the Ezrahite, or by David, in his name.</p>

<p>87:2. O Lord, the God of my salvation: I have cried in the day, and in
the night before thee.</p>

<p>87:3. Let my prayer come in before thee: incline thy ear to my petition.</p>

<p>87:4. For my soul is filled with evils: and my life hath drawn nigh to
hell.</p>

<p>87:5. I am counted among them that go down to the pit: I am become as a
man without help,</p>

<p>87:6. Free among the dead. Like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres,
whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.</p>

<p>87:7. They have laid me in the lower pit: in the dark places, and in the
shadow of death.</p>

<p>87:8. Thy wrath is strong over me: and all thy waves thou hast brought
in upon me.</p>

<p>87:9. Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me: they have set me
an abomination to themselves. I was delivered up, and came not forth:</p>

<p>87:10. My eyes languished through poverty. All the day I cried to thee,
O Lord: I stretched out my hands to thee.</p>

<p>87:11. Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? or shall physicians raise to
life, and give praise to thee?</p>

<p>87:12. Shall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy: and thy truth
in destruction?</p>

<p>87:13. Shall thy wonders be known in the dark; and thy justice in the
land of forgetfulness?</p>

<p>87:14. But I, O Lord, have cried to thee: and in the morning my prayer
shall prevent thee.</p>

<p>87:15. Lord, why castest thou off my prayer: why turnest thou away thy
face from me?</p>

<p>87:16. I am poor, and in labours from my youth: and being exalted have
been humbled and troubled.</p>

<p>87:17. Thy wrath hath come upon me: and thy terrors have troubled me.</p>

<p>87:18. They have come round about me like water all the day: they have
compassed me about together.</p>

<p>87:19. Friend and neighbour thou hast put far from me: and my
acquaintance, because of misery.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 88</p>

<p>Misericordias Domini.</p>

<p>The perpetuity of the church of Christ, in consequence of the promise of
God: which, notwithstanding, God permits her to suffer sometimes most
grievous afflictions.</p>

<p>88:1. Of understanding, for Ethan the Ezrahite.</p>

<p>88:2. The mercies of the Lord I will sing for ever. I will shew forth
thy truth with my mouth to generation and generation.</p>

<p>88:3. For thou hast said: Mercy shall be built up for ever in the
heavens: thy truth shall be prepared in them.</p>

<p>88:4. I have made a covenant with my elect: I have sworn to David my
servant:</p>

<p>88:5. Thy seed will I settle for ever. And I will build up thy throne
unto generation and generation.</p>

<p>88:6. The heavens shall confess thy wonders, O Lord: and thy truth in
the church of the saints.</p>

<p>88:7. For who in the clouds can be compared to the Lord: or who among
the sons of God shall be like to God?</p>

<p>88:8. God, who is glorified in the assembly of the saints: great and
terrible above all them that are about him.</p>

<p>88:9. O Lord God of hosts, who is like to thee? thou art mighty, O Lord,
and thy truth is round about thee.</p>

<p>88:10. Thou rulest the power of the sea: and appeasest the motion of the
waves thereof.</p>

<p>88:11. Thou hast humbled the proud one, as one that is slain: with the
arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies.</p>

<p>88:12. Thine are the heavens, and thine is the earth: the world and the
fulness thereof thou hast founded:</p>

<p>88:13. The north and the sea thou hast created. Thabor and Hermon shall
rejoice in thy name:</p>

<p>88:14. Thy arm is with might. Let thy hand be strengthened, and thy
right hand exalted:</p>

<p>88:15. Justice and judgment are the preparation of thy throne. Mercy and
truth shall go before thy face:</p>

<p>88:16. Blessed is the people that knoweth jubilation. They shall walk, O
Lord, in the light of thy countenance:</p>

<p>88:17. And in thy name they shall rejoice all the day, and in thy
justice they shall be exalted.</p>

<p>88:18. For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy good
pleasure shall our horn be exalted.</p>

<p>88:19. For our protection is of the Lord, and of our king the holy one
of Israel.</p>

<p>88:20. Then thou spokest in a vision to thy saints, and saidst: I have
laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of my
people.</p>

<p>88:21. I have found David my servant: with my holy oil I have anointed
him.</p>

<p>88:22. For my hand shall help him: and my arm shall strengthen him.</p>

<p>88:23. The enemy shall have no advantage over him: nor the son of
iniquity have power to hurt him.</p>

<p>88:24. And I will cut down his enemies before his face; and them that
hate him I will put to flight.</p>

<p>88:25. And my truth and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall
his horn be exalted.</p>

<p>88:26. And I will set his hand in the sea; and his right hand in the
rivers.</p>

<p>88:27. He shall cry out to me: Thou art my father: my God, and the
support of my salvation.</p>

<p>88:28. And I will make him my firstborn, high above the kings of the
earth.</p>

<p>88:29. I will keep my mercy for him for ever: and my covenant faithful
to him.</p>

<p>88:30. And I will make his seed to endure for evermore: and his throne
as the days of heaven.</p>

<p>88:31. And if his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments:</p>

<p>88:32. If they profane my justices: and keep not my commandments:</p>

<p>88:33. I will visit their iniquities with a rod and their sins with
stripes.</p>

<p>88:34. But my mercy I will not take away from him: nor will I suffer my
truth to fail.</p>

<p>88:35. Neither will I profane my covenant: and the words that proceed
from my mouth I will not make void.</p>

<p>88:36. Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David:</p>

<p>88:37. His seed shall endure for ever.</p>

<p>88:38. And his throne as the sun before me: and as the moon perfect for
ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.</p>

<p>88:39. But thou hast rejected and despised: thou hast been angry with my
anointed.</p>

<p>88:40. Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant: thou hast
profaned his sanctuary on the earth.</p>

<p>Overthrown the covenant, etc... All this seems to relate to the time of
the captivity of Babylon, in which, for the sins of the people and their
princes, God seemed to have set aside for a while the covenant he made
with David.</p>

<p>88:41. Thou hast broken down all his hedges: thou hast made his strength
fear.</p>

<p>88:42. All that pass by the way have robbed him: he is become a reproach
to his neighbours.</p>

<p>88:43. Thou hast set up the right hand of them that oppress him: thou
hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</p>

<p>88:44. Thou hast turned away the help of his sword; and hast not
assisted him in battle.</p>

<p>88:45. Thou hast made his purification to cease: and thou hast cast his
throne down to the ground.</p>

<p>88:46. Thou hast shortened the days of his time: thou hast covered him
with confusion.</p>

<p>88:47. How long, O Lord, turnest thou away unto the end? shall thy anger
burn like fire?</p>

<p>88:48. Remember what my substance is: for hast thou made all the
children of men in vain?</p>

<p>88:49. Who is the man that shall live, and not see death: that shall
deliver his soul from the hand of hell?</p>

<p>88:50. Lord, where are thy ancient mercies, according to what thou didst
swear to David in thy truth?</p>

<p>88:51. Be mindful, O Lord, of the reproach of thy servants (which I have
held in my bosom) of many nations:</p>

<p>88:52. Wherewith thy enemies have reproached, O Lord; wherewith they
have reproached the change of thy anointed.</p>

<p>88:53. Blessed be the Lord for evermore. So be it. So be it.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 89</p>

<p>Domine, refugium.</p>

<p>A prayer for the mercy of God: recounting the shortness and miseries of
the days of man.</p>

<p>89:1. A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our refuge
from generation to generation.</p>

<p>89:2. Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was
formed; from eternity and to eternity thou art God.</p>

<p>89:3. Turn not man away to be brought low: and thou hast said: Be
converted, O ye sons of men.</p>

<p>Turn not man away, etc... Suffer him not quite to perish from thee,
since thou art pleased to call upon him to be converted to thee.</p>

<p>89:4. For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is past.
And as a watch in the night,</p>

<p>89:5. Things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.</p>

<p>89:6. In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he
shall flourish and pass away: in the evening he shall fall, grow dry,
and wither.</p>

<p>89:7. For in thy wrath we have fainted away: and are troubled in thy
indignation.</p>

<p>89:8. Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: our life in the
light of thy countenance.</p>

<p>89:9. For all our days are spent; and in thy wrath we have fainted away.
Our years shall be considered as a spider:</p>

<p>As a spider... As frail and weak as a spider's web; and miserable
withal, whilst like a spider we spend our bowels in weaving webs to
catch flies.</p>

<p>89:10. The days of our years in them are threescore and ten years. But
if in the strong they be fourscore years: and what is more of them is
labour and sorrow. For mildness is come upon us: and we shall be
corrected.</p>

<p>Mildness is come upon us, etc... God's mildness corrects us; inasmuch as
he deals kindly with us, in shortening the days of this miserable life;
and so weaning our affections from all its transitory enjoyments, and
teaching us true wisdom.</p>

<p>89:11. Who knoweth the power of thy anger, and for thy fear</p>

<p>89:12. Can number thy wrath? &nbsp;So make thy right hand known: and men
learned in heart, in wisdom.</p>

<p>89:13. Return, O Lord, how long? and be entreated in favour of thy
servants.</p>

<p>89:14. We are filled in the morning with thy mercy: and we have
rejoiced, and are delighted all our days.</p>

<p>89:15. We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us: for
the years in which we have seen evils.</p>

<p>89:16. Look upon thy servants and upon their works: and direct their
children.</p>

<p>89:17. And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and direct
thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou
direct.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 90</p>

<p>Qui habitat.</p>

<p>The just is secure under the protection of God.</p>

<p>90:1. The praise of a canticle for David. He that dwelleth in the aid of
the most High, shall abide under the protection of the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>90:2. He shall say to the Lord: Thou art my protector, and my refuge: my
God, in him will I trust.</p>

<p>90:3. For he hath delivered me from the snare of the hunters: and from
the sharp word.</p>

<p>90:4. He will overshadow thee with his shoulders: and under his wings
thou shalt trust.</p>

<p>90:5. His truth shall compass thee with a shield: thou shalt not be
afraid of the terror of the night.</p>

<p>90:6. Of the arrow that flieth in the day, of the business that walketh
about in the dark: of invasion, or of the noonday devil.</p>

<p>90:7. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right
hand: but it shall not come nigh thee.</p>

<p>90:8. But thou shalt consider with thy eyes: and shalt see the reward of
the wicked.</p>

<p>90:9. Because thou, O Lord, art my hope: thou hast made the most High
thy refuge.</p>

<p>90:10. There shall no evil come to thee: nor shall the scourge come near
thy dwelling.</p>

<p>90:11. For he hath given his angels charge over thee; to keep thee in
all thy ways.</p>

<p>90:12. In their hands they shall bear thee up: lest thou dash thy foot
against a stone.</p>

<p>90:13. Thou shalt walk upon the asp and the basilisk: and thou shalt
trample under foot the lion and the dragon.</p>

<p>90:14. Because he hoped in me I will deliver him: I will protect him
because he hath known my name.</p>

<p>90:15. He shall cry to me, and I will hear him: I am with him in
tribulation, I will deliver him, and I will glorify him.</p>

<p>90:16. I will fill him with length of days; and I will shew him my
salvation.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 91</p>

<p>Bonum est confiteri.</p>

<p>God is to be praised for his wondrous works.</p>

<p>91:1. A psalm of a canticle on the sabbath day.</p>

<p>91:2. It is good to give praise to the Lord: and to sing to thy name, O
most High.</p>

<p>91:3. To shew forth thy mercy in the morning, and thy truth in the
night: 91:4. Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the psaltery: with
a canticle upon the harp.</p>

<p>91:5. For thou hast given me, O Lord, a delight in thy doings: and in
the works of thy hands I shall rejoice.</p>

<p>91:6. O Lord, how great are thy works! thy thoughts are exceeding deep.</p>

<p>91:7. The senseless man shall not know: nor will the fool understand
these things.</p>

<p>91:8. When the wicked shall spring up as grass: and all the workers of
iniquity shall appear: That they may perish for ever and ever:</p>

<p>91:9. But thou, O Lord, art most high for evermore.</p>

<p>91:10. For behold thy enemies, O lord, for behold thy enemies shall
perish: and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</p>

<p>91:11. But my horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn: and my old
age in plentiful mercy.</p>

<p>91:12. My eye also hath looked down upon my enemies: and my ear shall
hear of the downfall of the malignant that rise up against me.</p>

<p>91:13. The just shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow up like
the cedar of Libanus.</p>

<p>91:14. They that are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in
the courts of the house of our God.</p>

<p>91:15. They shall still increase in a fruitful old age: and shall be
well treated,</p>

<p>91:16. That they may shew, That the Lord our God is righteous, and there
is no iniquity in him.</p>

<p>Dominus regnavit.</p>

<p>The glory and stability of the kingdom; that is, of the church of
Christ.</p>

<p>Praise in the way of a canticle, for David himself, on the day before
the sabbath, when the earth was founded.</p>

<p>92:1. The Lord hath reigned, he is clothed with beauty: the Lord is
clothed with strength, and hath girded himself. For he hath established
the world which shall not be moved.</p>

<p>92:2. My throne is prepared from of old: thou art from everlasting.</p>

<p>92:3. The floods have lifted up, O Lord: the floods have lifted up their
voice. The floods have lifted up their waves,</p>

<p>92:4. With the noise of many waters. Wonderful are the surges of the
sea: wonderful is the Lord on high.</p>

<p>92:5. Thy testimonies are become exceedingly credible: holiness becometh
thy house, O Lord, unto length of days.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 93</p>

<p>Deus ultionum.</p>

<p>God shall judge and punish the oppressors of his people.</p>

<p>A psalm for David himself on the fourth day of the week.</p>

<p>93:1. The Lord is the God to whom revenge belongeth: the God of revenge
hath acted freely.</p>

<p>93:2. Lift up thyself, thou that judgest the earth: render a reward to
the proud.</p>

<p>93:3. How long shall sinners, O Lord: how long shall sinners glory?</p>

<p>93:4. Shall they utter, and speak iniquity: shall all speak who work
injustice?</p>

<p>93:5. Thy people, O Lord, they have brought low: and they have afflicted
thy inheritance.</p>

<p>93:6. They have slain the widow and the stranger: and they have murdered
the fatherless.</p>

<p>93:7. And they have said: The Lord shall not see: neither shall the God
of Jacob understand.</p>

<p>93:8. Understand, ye senseless among the people: and, you fools, be wise
at last.</p>

<p>93:9. He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? or he that formed the
eye, doth he not consider?</p>

<p>93:10. He that chastiseth nations, shall he not rebuke: he that teacheth
man knowledge?</p>

<p>93:11. The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, that they are vain.</p>

<p>93:12. Blessed is the man whom thou shalt instruct, O Lord: and shalt
teach him out of thy law.</p>

<p>93:13. That thou mayst give him rest from the evil days: till a pit be
dug for the wicked.</p>

<p>Rest from the evil days... That thou mayst mitigate the sorrows, to
which he is exposed, during the short and evil days of his mortality.</p>

<p>93:14. For the Lord will not cast off his people: neither will he
forsake his own inheritance.</p>

<p>93:15. Until justice be turned into judgment: and they that are near it
are all the upright in heart.</p>

<p>Until justice be turned into judgment, etc... By being put in execution;
which will be agreeable to all the upright in heart.</p>

<p>93:16. Who shall rise up for me against the evildoers? or who shall
stand with me against the workers of iniquity?</p>

<p>93:17. Unless the Lord had been my helper, my soul had almost dwelt in
hell.</p>

<p>93:18. If I said: My foot is moved: thy mercy, O Lord, assisted me.</p>

<p>93:19. According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, thy
comforts have given joy to my soul.</p>

<p>93:20. Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee, who framest labour in
commandment?</p>

<p>Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee, etc... That is, wilt thou, O
God, who art always just, admit of the seat of iniquity: that is, of
injustice, or unjust judges, to have any partnership with thee? Thou who
framest, or makest, labour in commandment, that is, thou who obligest us
to labour with all diligence to keep thy commandments.</p>

<p>93:21. They will hunt after the soul of the just, and will condemn
innocent blood.</p>

<p>93:22. But the Lord is my refuge: and my God the help of my hope.</p>

<p>93:23. And he will render them their iniquity: and in their malice he
will destroy them: the Lord our God will destroy them.</p>

our saviour.</p>

<p>94:2. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; and make a
joyful noise to him with psalms.</p>

<p>94:3. For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.</p>

<p>94:4. For in his hand are all the ends of the earth: and the heights of
the mountains are his.</p>

<p>94:5. For the sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry
land.</p>

<p>94:6. Come let us adore and fall down: and weep before the Lord that
made us.</p>

<p>94:7. For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture
and the sheep of his hand.</p>

<p>94:8. To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts:</p>

<p>94:9. As in the provocation, according to the day of temptation in the
wilderness: where your fathers tempted me, they proved me, and saw my
works.</p>

<p>94:10. Forty years long was I offended with that generation, and I said:
These always err in heart.</p>

<p>94:11. And these men have not known my ways: so I swore in my wrath that
they shall not enter into my rest.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 95</p>

<p>Cantate Domino.</p>

<p>An exhortation to praise God for the coming of Christ and his kingdom.</p>

<p>95:1. A canticle for David himself, when the house was built after the
captivity. Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: sing to the Lord, all the
earth.</p>

<p>When the house was built, etc... Alluding to that time, and then ordered
to be sung: but principally relating to the building of the church of
Christ, after our redemption from the captivity of Satan.</p>

<p>95:2. Sing ye to the Lord and bless his name: shew forth his salvation
from day to day.</p>

<p>95:3. Declare his glory among the Gentiles: his wonders among all
people.</p>

<p>95:4. For the Lord is great, and exceedingly to be praised: he is to be
feared above all gods.</p>

<p>95:5. For all the gods of the Gentiles are devils: but the Lord made the
heavens.</p>

<p>95:6. Praise and beauty are before him: holiness and majesty in his
sanctuary.</p>

<p>95:7. Bring ye to the Lord, O ye kindreds of the Gentiles, bring ye to
the Lord glory and honour:</p>

<p>95:8. Bring to the Lord glory unto his name. Bring up sacrifices, and
come into his courts:</p>

his presence.</p>

<p>95:10. Say ye among the Gentiles, the Lord hath reigned. For he hath
corrected the world, which shall not be moved: he will judge the people
with justice.</p>

<p>95:11. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad, let the sea
be moved, and the fulness thereof:</p>

<p>95:12. The fields and all things that are in them shall be joyful. Then
shall all the trees of the woods rejoice</p>

<p>95:13. before the face of the Lord, because he cometh: because he cometh
to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with justice, and the
people with his truth.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 96</p>

<p>Dominus regnavit.</p>

<p>All are invited to rejoice at the glorious coming and reign of Christ.</p>

<p>96:1. For the same David, when his land was restored again to him. The
Lord hath reigned, let the earth rejoice: let many islands be glad.</p>

<p>96:2. Clouds and darkness are round about him: justice and judgment are
the establishment of his throne.</p>

<p>Clouds and darkness... The coming of Christ in the clouds with great
terror and majesty to judge the world, is here prophesied.</p>

<p>96:3. A fire shall go before him, and shall burn his enemies round
about.</p>

<p>96:4. His lightnings have shone forth to the world: the earth saw and
trembled.</p>

<p>96:5. The mountains melted like wax, at the presence of the Lord: at the
presence of the Lord of all the earth.</p>

<p>96:6. The heavens declared his justice: and all people saw his glory.</p>

<p>96:7. Let them be all confounded that adore graven things, and that
glory in their idols. Adore him, all you his angels:</p>

<p>96:8. Sion heard, and was glad. And the daughters of Juda rejoiced,
because of thy judgments, O Lord.</p>

<p>96:9. For thou art the most high Lord over all the earth: thou art
exalted exceedingly above all gods.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 97</p>

<p>Cantate Domino.</p>

<p>All are again invited to praise the Lord, for the victories of Christ.</p>

<p>97:1. A psalm for David himself. Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle:
because he hath done wonderful things. His right hand hath wrought for
him salvation, and his arm is holy.</p>

<p>97:2. The Lord hath made known his salvation: he hath revealed his
justice in the sight of the Gentiles.</p>

<p>97:3. He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>

<p>97:4. Sing joyfully to God, all the earth; make melody, rejoice and
sing.</p>

<p>97:5. Sing praise to the Lord on the harp, on the harp, and with the
voice of a psalm:</p>

<p>97:6. With long trumpets, and sound of cornet. Make a joyful noise
before the Lord our king:</p>

<p>97:7. Let the sea be moved and the fullness thereof: the world and they
that dwell therein.</p>

<p>97:8. The rivers shall clap their hands, the mountains shall rejoice
together</p>

<p>97:9. At the presence of the Lord: because he cometh to judge the earth.
He shall judge the world with justice, and the people with equity.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 98</p>

<p>Dominus regnavit.</p>

<p>The reign of the Lord in Sion: that is, of Christ in his church.</p>

<p>98:1. A psalm for David himself. The Lord hath reigned, let the people
be angry: he that sitteth on the cherubims: let the earth be moved.</p>

<p>Let the people be angry... Though many enemies rage, and the whole earth
be stirred up to oppose the reign of Christ, he shall still prevail.</p>

<p>98:2. The lord is great in Sion, and high above all people.</p>

<p>98:3. Let them give praise to thy great name: for it is terrible and
holy:</p>

<p>98:4. And the king's honour loveth judgment. Thou hast prepared
directions: thou hast done judgment and justice in Jacob.</p>

<p>Loveth judgment... Requireth discretion.-Ibid. Directions... Most right
and just laws to direct men.</p>

<p>98:5. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore his footstool, for it is
holy.</p>

<p>Adore his footstool... The ark of the covenant was called, in the Old
Testament, God's footstool: over which he was understood to sit, on his
propitiatory, or mercy seat, as on a throne, between the wings of the
cherubims, in the sanctuary: to which the children of Israel paid a
great veneration. But as this psalm evidently relates to Christ, and the
New Testament, where the ark has no place, the holy fathers understand
this text, of the worship paid by the church to the body and blood of
Christ in the sacred mysteries: inasmuch as the humanity of Christ is,
as it were, the footstool of the divinity. So St. Ambrose, L. 3. De
Spiritu Sancto, c. 12. And St. Augustine upon this psalm.</p>

<p>98:6. Moses and Aaron among his priests: and Samuel among them that call
upon his name. They called upon the Lord, and he heard them:</p>

<p>Moses and Aaron among his priests... By this it is evident, that Moses
also was a priest, and indeed the chief priest, inasmuch as he
consecrated Aaron, and offered sacrifice for him. Lev. 8. So that his
pre-eminence over Aaron makes nothing for lay church headship.</p>

<p>98:7. He spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud. They kept his
testimonies, and the commandment which he gave them.</p>

<p>98:8. Thou didst hear them, O Lord our God: thou wast a merciful God to
them, and taking vengeance on all their inventions.</p>

<p>All their inventions... that is, all the enterprises of their enemies
against them, as in the case of Core, Dathan, and Abiron.</p>

<p>98:9. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore at his holy mountain: for the
Lord our God is holy.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 99</p>

<p>Jubilate Deo.</p>

<p>All are invited to rejoice in God the creator of all.</p>

<p>99:1. A psalm of praise.</p>

<p>99:2. Sing joyfully to God, all the earth: serve ye the Lord with
gladness. Come in before his presence with exceeding great joy.</p>

<p>99:3. Know ye that the Lord he is God: he made us, and not we ourselves.
We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.</p>

<p>99:4. Go ye into his gates with praise, into his courts with hymns: and
give glory to him. Praise ye his name:</p>

<p>99:5. For the Lord is sweet, his mercy endureth for ever, and his truth
to generation and generation.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 100</p>

<p>Misericordiam et judicium.</p>

<p>The prophet exhorteth all by his example, to follow mercy and justice.</p>

<p>100:1. A psalm for David himself. Mercy and judgment I will sing to
thee, O Lord: I will sing,</p>

<p>100:2. And I will understand in the unspotted way, when thou shalt come
to me. I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.</p>

<p>I will understand, etc... That is, I will apply my mind, I will do my
endeavour, to know and to follow the perfect way of thy commandments:
not trusting to my own strength, but relying on thy coming to me by thy
grace.</p>

<p>100:3. I will not set before my eyes any unjust thing: I hated the
workers of iniquities.</p>

<p>100:4. The perverse heart did not cleave to me: and the malignant, that
turned aside from me, I would not know.</p>

<p>100:5. The man that in private detracted his neighbour, him did I
persecute. With him that had a proud eye, and an unsatiable heart, I
would not eat.</p>

<p>100:6. My eyes were upon the faithful of the earth, to sit with me: the
man that walked in the perfect way, he served me.</p>

<p>100:7. He that worketh pride shall not dwell in the midst of my house:
he that speaketh unjust things did not prosper before my eyes.</p>

<p>100:8. In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land: that I
might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 101</p>

<p>Domine, exaudi.</p>

<p>A prayer for one in affliction: the fifth penitential psalm.</p>

<p>101:1. The prayer of the poor man, when he was anxious, and poured out
his supplication before the Lord.</p>

<p>101:2. Hear, O Lord, my prayer: and let my cry come to thee.</p>

<p>101:3. Turn not away thy face from me: in the day when I am in trouble,
incline thy ear to me. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear
me speedily.</p>

<p>101:4. For my days are vanished like smoke, and my bones are grown dry
like fuel for the fire.</p>

<p>101:5. I am smitten as grass, and my heart is withered: because I forgot
to eat my bread.</p>

<p>101:6. Through the voice of my groaning, my bone hath cleaved to my
flesh.</p>

<p>101:7. I am become like to a pelican of the wilderness: I am like a
night raven in the house.</p>

<p>A pelican, etc... I am become through grief, like birds that affect
solitude and darkness.</p>

<p>101:8. I have watched, and am become as a sparrow all alone on the
housetop.</p>

<p>101:9. All the day long my enemies reproached me: and they that praised
me did swear against me.</p>

<p>101:10. For I did eat ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
weeping.</p>

<p>101:11. Because of thy anger and indignation: for having lifted me up
thou hast thrown me down.</p>

<p>101:12. My days have declined like a shadow, and I am withered like
grass.</p>

<p>101:13. But thou, O Lord, endurest for ever: and thy memorial to all
generations.</p>

<p>101:14. Thou shalt arise and have mercy on Sion: for it is time to have
mercy on it, for the time is come.</p>

<p>101:15. For the stones thereof have pleased thy servants: and they shall
have pity on the earth thereof.</p>

<p>101:16. All the Gentiles shall fear thy name, O Lord, and all the kings
of the earth thy glory.</p>

<p>101:17. For the Lord hath built up Sion: and he shall be seen in his
glory.</p>

<p>101:18. He hath had regard to the prayer of the humble: and he hath not
despised their petition.</p>

<p>101:19. Let these things be written unto another generation: and the
people that shall be created shall praise the Lord:</p>

<p>101:20. Because he hath looked forth from his high sanctuary: from
heaven the Lord hath looked upon the earth.</p>

<p>101:21. That he might hear the groans of them that are in fetters: that
he might release the children of the slain:</p>

<p>101:22. That they may declare the name of the Lord in Sion: and his
praise in Jerusalem;</p>

<p>101:23. When the people assemble together, and kings, to serve the Lord.</p>

<p>101:24. He answered him in the way of his strength: Declare unto me the
fewness of my days.</p>

<p>He answered him in the way of his strength... That is, the people,
mentioned in the foregoing verse, or the penitent, in whose person this
psalm is delivered, answered the Lord in the way of his strength: that
is, according to the best of his power and strength: or when he was in
the flower of his age and strength: inquiring after the fewness of his
days: to know if he should live long enough to see the happy restoration
of Sion, etc.</p>

<p>101:25. Call me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are unto
generation and generation.</p>

<p>101:26. In the beginning, O Lord, thou foundedst the earth: and the
heavens are the works of thy hands.</p>

<p>101:27. They shall perish but thou remainest: and all of them shall grow
old like a garment: And as a vesture thou shalt change them, and they
shall be changed.</p>

<p>101:28. But thou art always the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail.</p>

<p>101:29. The children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall
be directed for ever.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 102</p>

<p>Benedic, anima.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving to God for his mercies.</p>

<p>102:1. For David himself. Bless the Lord, O my soul: and let all that is
within me bless his holy name.</p>

<p>102:2. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and never forget all he hath done for
thee.</p>

<p>102:3. Who forgiveth all thy iniquities: who healeth all thy diseases.</p>

<p>102:4. Who redeemeth thy life from destruction: who crowneth thee with
mercy and compassion.</p>

<p>102:5. Who satisfieth thy desire with good things: thy youth shall be
renewed like the eagle's.</p>

<p>102:6. The Lord doth mercies, and judgment for all that suffer wrong.</p>

<p>102:7. He hath made his ways known to Moses: his wills to the children
of Israel.</p>

<p>102:8. The Lord is compassionate and merciful: longsuffering and
plenteous in mercy. 102:9. He will not always be angry: nor will he
threaten for ever.</p>

<p>102:10. He hath not dealt with us according to our sins: nor rewarded us
according to our iniquities.</p>

<p>102:11. For according to the height of the heaven above the earth: he
hath strengthened his mercy towards them that fear him.</p>

<p>102:12. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
iniquities from us.</p>

<p>102:13. As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord
compassion on them that fear him:</p>

<p>102:14. For he knoweth our frame. He remembereth that we are dust:</p>

<p>102:15. Man's days are as grass, as the flower of the field so shall he
flourish.</p>

<p>102:16. For the spirit shall pass in him, and he shall not be: and he
shall know his place no more.</p>

<p>102:17. But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity and unto eternity
upon them that fear him: And his justice unto children's children,</p>

<p>102:18. To such as keep his covenant, And are mindful of his
commandments to do them.</p>

<p>102:19. The lord hath prepared his throne in heaven: and his kingdom
shall rule over all.</p>

<p>102:20. Bless the Lord, all ye his angels: you that are mighty in
strength, and execute his word, hearkening to the voice of his orders.</p>

<p>102:21. Bless the Lord, all ye his hosts: you ministers of his that do
his will.</p>

<p>102:22. Bless the Lord, all his works: in every place of his dominion, O
my soul, bless thou the Lord.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 103</p>

<p>Benedic, anima.</p>

<p>God is to be praised for his mighty works, and wonderful providence.</p>

<p>103:1. For David himself. Bless the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou
art exceedingly great. Thou hast put on praise and beauty:</p>

<p>103:2. And art clothed with light as with a garment. Who stretchest out
the heaven like a pavilion:</p>

<p>103:3. Who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water. Who makest the
clouds thy chariot: who walkest upon the wings of the winds.</p>

<p>103:4. Who makest thy angels spirits: and thy ministers a burning fire.</p>

<p>103:5. Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases: it shall not be
moved for ever and ever.</p>

<p>103:6. The deep like a garment is its clothing: above the mountains
shall the waters stand.</p>

<p>103:7. At thy rebuke they shall flee: at the voice of thy thunder they
shall fear.</p>

<p>103:8. The mountains ascend, and the plains descend into the place which
thou hast founded for them.</p>

<p>103:9. Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over; neither
shall they return to cover the earth.</p>

<p>103:10. Thou sendest forth springs in the vales: between the midst of
the hills the waters shall pass.</p>

<p>103:11. All the beasts of the field shall drink: the wild asses shall
expect in their thirst.</p>

<p>103:12. Over them the birds of the air shall dwell: from the midst of
the rocks they shall give forth their voices.</p>

<p>103:13. Thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms: the earth shall be
filled with the fruit of thy works:</p>

<p>103:14. Bringing forth grass for cattle, and herb for the service of
men. That thou mayst bring bread out of the earth:</p>

<p>103:15. And that wine may cheer the heart of man. That he may make the
face cheerful with oil: and that bread may strengthen man's heart.</p>

<p>103:16. The trees of the field shall be filled, and the cedars of
Libanus which he hath planted:</p>

<p>103:17. There the sparrows shall make their nests. The highest of them
is the house of the heron.</p>

<p>103:18. The high hills are a refuge for the harts, the rock for the
irchins.</p>

<p>103:19. He hath made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
down.</p>

<p>103:20. Thou hast appointed darkness, and it is night: in it shall all
the beasts of the woods go about:</p>

<p>103:21. The young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat
from God.</p>

<p>103:22. The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together: and they shall
lie down in their dens.</p>

<p>103:23. Man shall go forth to his work, and to his labour until the
evening.</p>

<p>103:24. How great are thy works, O Lord? thou hast made all things in
wisdom: the earth is filled with thy riches.</p>

<p>103:25. So is this great sea, which stretcheth wide its arms: there are
creeping things without number: Creatures little and great.</p>

<p>103:26. There the ships shall go. This sea dragon which thou hast formed
to play therein.</p>

<p>103:27. All expect of thee that thou give them food in season.</p>

<p>103:28. What thou givest to them they shall gather up: when thou openest
thy hand, they shall all be filled with good.</p>

<p>103:29. But if thou turnest away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou
shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall return to
their dust.</p>

<p>103:30. Thou shalt send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: and
thou shalt renew the face of the earth.</p>

<p>103:31. May the glory of the Lord endure for ever: the Lord shall
rejoice in his works.</p>

<p>103:32. He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble: he troubleth
the mountains, and they smoke.</p>

<p>103:33. I will sing to the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to
my God while I have my being.</p>

<p>103:34. Let my speech be acceptable to him: but I will take delight in
the Lord.</p>

<p>103:35. Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the unjust, so
that they be no more: O my soul, bless thou the Lord.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 104</p>

<p>Confitemini Domino.</p>

<p>A thanksgiving to God for his benefits to his people Israel.</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>104:1. Give glory to the Lord, and call upon his name: declare his deeds
among the Gentiles.</p>

<p>104:2. Sing to him, yea sing praises to him: relate all his wondrous
works.</p>

<p>104:3. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
seek the Lord.</p>

<p>104:4. Seek ye the lord, and be strengthened: seek his face evermore.</p>

<p>104:5. Remember his marvellous works which he hath done; his wonders,
and the judgments of his mouth.</p>

<p>104:6. O ye seed of Abraham his servant; ye sons of Jacob his chosen.</p>

<p>104:7. He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</p>

<p>104:8. He hath remembered his covenant for ever: the word which he
commanded to a thousand generations.</p>

<p>104:9. Which he made to Abraham; and his oath to Isaac:</p>

<p>104:10. And he appointed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for
an everlasting testament:</p>

<p>104:11. Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the lot of your
inheritance.</p>

<p>104:12. When they were but a small number: yea very few, and sojourners
therein:</p>

<p>104:13. And they passed from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to
another people.</p>

<p>104:14. He suffered no man to hurt them: and he reproved kings for their
sakes.</p>

<p>104:15. Touch ye not my anointed: and do no evil to my prophets.</p>

<p>104:16. And he called a famine upon the land: and he broke in pieces all
the support of bread.</p>

<p>104:17. He sent a man before them: Joseph, who was sold for a slave.</p>

<p>104:18. They humbled his feet in fetters: the iron pierced his soul,</p>

<p>104:19. Until his word came. The word of the Lord inflamed him.</p>

<p>104:20. The king sent, and he released him: the ruler of the people, and
he set him at liberty.</p>

<p>104:21. He made him master of his house, and ruler of all his
possession.</p>

<p>104:22. That he might instruct his princes as himself, and teach his
ancients wisdom.</p>

<p>104:23. And Israel went into Egypt: and Jacob was a sojourner in the
land of Cham.</p>

<p>104:24. And he increased his people exceedingly: and strengthened them
over their enemies.</p>

<p>104:25. He turned their heart to hate his people: and to deal
deceitfully with his servants.</p>

<p>He turned their heart, etc... Not that God (who is never the author of
sin) moved the Egyptians to hate and persecute his people; but that the
Egyptians took occasion of hating and envying them, from the sight of
the benefits which God bestowed upon them.</p>

<p>104:26. He sent Moses his servant: Aaron the man whom he had chosen.</p>

<p>104:27. He gave them power to shew them signs, and his wonders in the
land of Cham.</p>

<p>104:28. He sent darkness, and made it obscure: and grieved not his
words.</p>

<p>Grieved not his words... That is, he was not wanting to fulfil his
words: or he did not grieve Moses and Aaron, the carriers of his words:
or he did not grieve his words, that is, his sons, the children of
Israel, who enjoyed light whilst the Egyptians were oppressed with
darkness.</p>

<p>104:29. He turned their waters into blood, and destroyed their fish.</p>

<p>104:30. Their land brought forth frogs, in the inner chambers of their
kings.</p>

<p>104:31. He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies and sciniphs in
all their coasts.</p>

<p>Sciniphs... See the annotation, Ex.8.16.</p>

<p>104:32. He gave them hail for rain, a burning fire in the land.</p>

<p>104:33. And he destroyed their vineyards and their fig trees: and he
broke in pieces the trees of their coasts.</p>

<p>104:34. He spoke, and the locust came, and the bruchus, of which there
was no number.</p>

<p>Bruchus... An insect of the locust kind.</p>

<p>104:35. And they devoured all the grass in their land, and consumed all
the fruit of their ground.</p>

<p>104:36. And he slew all the firstborn in their land: the firstfruits of
all their labour.</p>

<p>104:37. And he brought them out with silver and gold: and there was not
among their tribes one that was feeble.</p>

<p>104:38. Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them lay upon
them.</p>

<p>104:39. He spread a cloud for their protection, and fire to give them
light in the night.</p>

<p>104:40. They asked, and the quail came: and he filled them with the
bread of heaven.</p>

<p>104:41. He opened the rock, and waters flowed: rivers ran down in the
dry land.</p>

<p>104:42. Because he remembered his holy word, which he had spoken to his
servant Abraham.</p>

<p>104:43. And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with
gladness.</p>

<p>104:44. And he gave them the lands of the Gentiles: and they possessed
the labours of the people:</p>

<p>104:45. That they might observe his justifications, and seek after his
law.</p>

<p>His justifications... That is, his commandments; which here, and in many
other places of the scripture, are called justifications, because the
keeping of them makes man just. The Protestants render it by the word
statutes, in favour of their doctrine, which does not allow good works
to justify.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 105</p>

<p>Confitemini Domino.</p>

<p>A confession of the manifold sins and ingratitudes of the Israelites.</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>105:1. Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth
for ever.</p>

<p>105:2. Who shall declare the powers of the Lord? who shall set forth all
his praises?</p>

<p>105:3. Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do justice at all times.</p>

<p>105:4. Remember us, O Lord, in the favour of thy people: visit us with
thy salvation.</p>

<p>105:5. That we may see the good of thy chosen, that we may rejoice in
the joy of thy nation: that thou mayst be praised with thy inheritance.</p>

<p>105:6. We have sinned with our fathers: we have acted unjustly, we have
wrought iniquity.</p>

<p>105:7. Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt: they remembered
not the multitude of thy mercies: And they provoked to wrath going up to
the sea, even the Red Sea.</p>

<p>105:8. And he saved them for his own name's sake: that he might make his
power known.</p>

<p>105:9. And he rebuked the Red Sea and it was dried up: and he led them
through the depths, as in a wilderness.</p>

<p>105:10. And he saved them from the hand of them that hated them: and he
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>

<p>105:11. And the water covered them that afflicted them: there was not
one of them left.</p>

<p>105:12. And they believed his words: and they sang his praises.</p>

<p>105:13. They had quickly done, they forgot his works: and they waited
not for his counsel.</p>

<p>105:14. And they coveted their desire in the desert: and they tempted
God in the place without water.</p>

<p>105:15. And he gave them their request: and sent fulness into their
souls.</p>

<p>105:16. And they provoked Moses in the camp, Aaron the holy one of the
Lord.</p>

<p>105:17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the
congregation of Abiron.</p>

<p>105:18. And a fire was kindled in their congregation: the flame burned
the wicked.</p>

<p>105:19. They made also a calf in Horeb: and they adored the graven
thing.</p>

<p>105:20. And they changed their glory into the likeness of a calf that
eateth grass.</p>

<p>105:21. They forgot God, who saved them, who had done great things in
Egypt,</p>

<p>105:22. Wondrous works in the land of Cham: terrible things in the Red
Sea.</p>

<p>105:23. And he said that he would destroy them: had not Moses his chosen
stood before him in the breach: To turn away his wrath, lest he should
destroy them.</p>

<p>105:24. And they set at nought the desirable land. They believed not his
word,</p>

<p>105:25. And they murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the
voice of the Lord.</p>

<p>105:26. And he lifted up his hand over them: to overthrow them in the
desert;</p>

<p>105:27. And to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter
them in the countries.</p>

<p>105:28. They also were initiated to Beelphegor: and ate the sacrifices
of the dead.</p>

<p>Initiated... That is, they dedicated, or consecrated themselves to the
idol of the Moabites and Madianites, called Beelphegor, or Baal-Peor.
Num. 25.3.-Ibid. The dead... Viz., idols without life.</p>

<p>105:29. And they provoked him with their inventions: and destruction was
multiplied among them.</p>

<p>105:30. Then Phinees stood up, and pacified him: and the slaughter
ceased.</p>

<p>105:31. And it was reputed to him unto justice, to generation and
generation for evermore.</p>

<p>105:32. They provoked him also at the waters of contradiction: and Moses
was afflicted for their sakes:</p>

<p>105:33. Because they exasperated his spirit. And he distinguished with
his lips.</p>

<p>He distinguished with his lips... Moses, by occasion of the people's
rebellion and incredulity, was guilty of distinguishing with his lips;
when, instead of speaking to the rock, as God had commanded, he said to
the people, with a certain hesitation in his faith, Hear ye, rebellious
and incredulous: Can we from this rock bring out water for you? Num.
20.10.</p>

<p>105:34. They did not destroy the nations of which the Lord spoke unto
them.</p>

<p>105:35. And they were mingled among the heathens, and learned their
works:</p>

<p>105:36. And served their idols, and it became a stumblingblock to them.</p>

<p>105:37. And they sacrificed their sons, and their daughters to devils.</p>

<p>105:38. And they shed innocent blood: the blood of their sons and of
their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan. And the
land was polluted with blood,</p>

<p>105:39. And was defiled with their works: and they went aside after
their own inventions.</p>

<p>105:40. And the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people: and he
abhorred his inheritance.</p>

<p>105:41. And he delivered them into the hands of the nations: and they
that hated them had dominion over them.</p>

<p>105:42. And their enemies afflicted them: and they were humbled under
their hands:</p>

<p>105:43. Many times did he deliver them. But they provoked him with their
counsel: and they were brought low by their iniquities.</p>

<p>105:44. And he saw when they were in tribulation: and he heard their
prayer.</p>

<p>105:45. And he was mindful of his covenant: and repented according to
the multitude of his mercies.</p>

<p>105:46. And he gave them unto mercies, in the sight of all those that
had made them captives.</p>

<p>105:47. Save us, O Lord, our God: and gather us from among the nations:
That we may give thanks to thy holy name, and may glory in thy praise.</p>

<p>105:48. Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, from everlasting to
everlasting: and let all the people say: So be it, so be it.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 106</p>

<p>Confitemini Domino.</p>

<p>All are invited to give thanks to God for his perpetual providence over
men..</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>106:1. Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth
for ever.</p>

<p>106:2. Let them say so that have been redeemed by the Lord, whom he hath
redeemed from the hand of the enemy: and gathered out of the countries.</p>

<p>106:3. From the rising and from the setting of the sun, from the north
and from the sea.</p>

<p>106:4. They wandered in a wilderness, in a place without water: they
found not the way of a city for their habitation.</p>

<p>106:5. They were hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.</p>

<p>106:6. And they cried to the Lord in their tribulation: and he delivered
them out of their distresses.</p>

<p>106:7. And he led them into the right way, that they might go to a city
of habitation.</p>

<p>106:8. Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful
works to the children of men.</p>

<p>106:9. For he hath satisfied the empty soul, and hath filled the hungry
soul with good things.</p>

<p>106:10. Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death: bound in
want and in iron.</p>

<p>106:11. Because they had exasperated the words of God: and provoked the
counsel of the most High:</p>

<p>106:12. And their heart was humbled with labours: they were weakened,
and there was none to help them.</p>

<p>106:13. Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he
delivered them out of their distresses.</p>

<p>106:14. And he brought them out of darkness, and the shadow of death;
and broke their bonds in sunder.</p>

<p>106:15. Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful
works to the children of men.</p>

<p>106:16. Because he hath broken gates of brass, and burst iron bars.</p>

<p>106:17. He took them out of the way of their iniquity: for they were
brought low for their injustices.</p>

<p>106:18. Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they drew nigh even
to the gates of death.</p>

<p>106:19. And they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he delivered
them out of their distresses.</p>

<p>106:20. He sent his word, and healed them: and delivered them from their
destructions.</p>

<p>106:21. Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful
works to the children of men.</p>

<p>106:22. And let them sacrifice the sacrifice of praise: and declare his
works with joy.</p>

<p>106:23. They that go down to the sea in ships, doing business in the
great waters:</p>

<p>106:24. These have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the
deep.</p>

<p>106:25. He said the word, and there arose a storm of wind: and the waves
thereof were lifted up.</p>

<p>106:26. They mount up to the heavens, and they go down to the depths:
their soul pined away with evils.</p>

<p>106:27. They were troubled, and reeled like a drunken man; and all their
wisdom was swallowed up.</p>

<p>106:28. And they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he brought
them out of their distresses.</p>

<p>106:29. And he turned the storm into a breeze: and its waves were still.</p>

<p>106:30. And they rejoiced because they were still: and he brought them
to the haven which they wished for.</p>

<p>106:31. Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful
works to the children of men.</p>

<p>106:32. And let them exalt him in the church of the people: and praise
him in the chair of the ancients.</p>

<p>106:33. He hath turned rivers into a wilderness: and the sources of
waters into dry ground:</p>

<p>106:34. A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that
dwell therein.</p>

<p>106:35. He hath turned a wilderness into pools of waters, and a dry land
into water springs.</p>

<p>106:36. And hath placed there the hungry; and they made a city for their
habitation.</p>

<p>106:37. Anti they sowed fields, and planted vineyards: and they yielded
fruit of birth.</p>

<p>106:38. And he blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly: and
their cattle he suffered not to decrease.</p>

<p>106:39. Then they were brought to be few: and they were afflicted
through the trouble of evils and sorrow.</p>

<p>106:40. Contempt was poured forth upon their princes: and he caused them
to wander where there was no passing, and out of the way.</p>

<p>106:41. And he helped the poor out of poverty: and made him families
like a flock of sheep.</p>

<p>106:42. The just shall see, and shall rejoice, and all iniquity shall
stop her mouth.</p>

<p>106:43. Who is wise, and will keep these things; and will understand the
mercies of the Lord?</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 107</p>

<p>Paratum cor meum.</p>

<p>The prophet praiseth God for benefits received.</p>

<p>107:1. A canticle of a psalm for David himself.</p>

<p>107:2. My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: I will sing, and
will give praise, with my glory.</p>

<p>107:3. Arise, my glory; arise, psaltery and harp: I will arise in the
morning early.</p>

<p>107:4. I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing
unto thee among the nations.</p>

<p>107:5. For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth even unto
the clouds.</p>

<p>107:6. Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory over all
the earth:</p>

<p>107:7. That thy beloved may be delivered. Save with thy right hand and
hear me.</p>

<p>107:8. God hath spoken in his holiness. I will rejoice, and I will
divide Sichem and I will mete out the vale of tabernacles.</p>

<p>107:9. Galaad is mine: and Manasses is mine and Ephraim the protection
of my head. Juda is my king:</p>

<p>107:10. Moab the pot of my hope. Over Edom I will stretch out my shoe:
the aliens are become my friends.</p>

<p>107:11. Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
Edom?</p>

<p>107:12. Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,
O God, go forth with our armies?</p>

<p>107:13. O grant us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.</p>

<p>107:14. Through God we shall do mightily: and he will bring our enemies
to nothing.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 108</p>

<p>Deus, laudem meam.</p>

<p>David in the person of Christ, prayeth against his persecutors; more
especially the traitor Judas: foretelling and approving his just
punishment for his obstinacy in sin and final impenitence.</p>

<p>108:1. Unto the end, a psalm for David.</p>

<p>108:2. O God, be not thou silent in my praise: for the mouth of the
wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me.</p>

<p>108:3. They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues; and they have
compassed me about with words of hatred; and have fought against me
without cause.</p>

<p>108:4. Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me: but I
gave myself to prayer.</p>

<p>108:5. And they repaid me evil for good: and hatred for my love.</p>

<p>108:6. Set thou the sinner over him: and may the devil stand at his
right hand.</p>

<p>Set thou the sinner over him, etc... Give to the devil, that arch-
sinner, power over him: let him enter into him, and possess him. The
imprecations, contained in the thirty verses of this psalm, are opposed
to the thirty pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed our Lord; and
are to be taken as prophetic denunciations of the evils that should
befall the traitor and his accomplices the Jews; and not properly as
curses.</p>

<p>108:7. When he is judged, may he go out condemned; and may his prayer be
turned to sin.</p>

<p>108:8. May his days be few: and his bishopric let another take.</p>

<p>108:9. May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>

<p>108:10. Let his children be carried about vagabonds, and beg; and let
them be cast out of their dwellings.</p>

<p>108:11. May the usurer search all his substance: and let strangers
plunder his labours.</p>

<p>108:12. May there be none to help him: nor none to pity his fatherless
offspring.</p>

<p>108:13. May his posterity be cut off; in one generation may his name be
blotted out.</p>

<p>108:14. May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered in the sight of
the Lord: and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>

<p>108:15. May they be before the Lord continually, and let the memory of
them perish from the earth: &nbsp;&nbsp;16 &nbsp;because he remembered not to shew
mercy,</p>

<p>108:17. But persecuted the poor man and the beggar; and the broken in
heart, to put him to death.</p>

<p>108:18. And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him: and he would
not have blessing, and it shall be far from him. And he put on cursing,
like a garment: and it went in like water into his entrails, and like
oil in his bones.</p>

<p>108:19. May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; and like a
girdle with which he is girded continually.</p>

<p>108:20. This is the work of them who detract me before the Lord; and who
speak evils against my soul.</p>

<p>108:21. But thou, O Lord, do with me for thy name's sake: because thy
mercy is sweet. Do thou deliver me,</p>

<p>108:22. For I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me.</p>

<p>108:23. I am taken away like the shadow when it declineth: and I am
shaken off as locusts.</p>

<p>108:24. My knees are weakened through fasting: and my flesh is changed
for oil.</p>

<p>For oil... Propter oleum. The meaning is, my flesh is changed, being
perfectly emaciated and dried up, as having lost all its oil or fatness.</p>

<p>108:25. And I am become a reproach to them: they saw me and they shaked
their heads.</p>

<p>108:26. Help me, O Lord my God; save me; according to thy mercy.</p>

<p>108:27. And let them know that this is thy hand: and that thou, O Lord,
hast done it.</p>

<p>108:28. They will curse and thou wilt bless: let them that rise up
against me be confounded: but thy servant shall rejoice.</p>

<p>108:29. Let them that detract me be clothed with shame: and let them be
covered with their confusion as with a double cloak.</p>

<p>108:30. I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth: and in the
midst of many I will praise him.</p>

<p>108:31. Because he hath stood at the right hand of the poor, to save my
soul from persecutors.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 109</p>

rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.</p>

brightness of the saints: from the womb before the day star I begot
thee.</p>

for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.</p>

<p>109:5. The Lord at thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of his
wrath.</p>

<p>109:6. He shall judge among nations, he shall fill ruins: he shall crush
the heads in the land of many.</p>

<p>109:7. He shall drink of the torrent in the way: therefore shall he lift
up the head.</p>

wills.</p>

<p>110:3. His work is praise and magnificence: and his justice continueth
for ever and ever.</p>

<p>110:4. He hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a
merciful and gracious Lord:</p>

<p>110:5. He hath given food to them that fear him. He will be mindful for
ever of his covenant:</p>

<p>110:6. He will shew forth to his people the power of his works.</p>

<p>110:7. That he may give them the inheritance of the Gentiles: the works
of his hands are truth and judgment.</p>

<p>110:8. All his commandments are faithful: confirmed for ever and ever,
made in truth and equity.</p>

<p>110:9. He hath sent redemption to his people: he hath commanded his
covenant for ever. Holy and terrible is his name:</p>

<p>110:10. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. A good
understanding to all that do it: his praise continueth for ever and

<p>Psalms Chapter 111</p>

<p>Beatus vir.</p>

<p>The good man is happy.</p>

<p>Alleluia, of the returning of Aggeus and Zacharias.</p>

<p>Of the returning, etc... This is in the Greek and Latin, but not in the
Hebrew. It signifies that this psalm was proper to be sung at the time
of the return of the people from their captivity; to inculcate to them,
how happy they might be, if they would be constant in the service of
God.</p>

<p>111:1. Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord: he shall delight
exceedingly in his commandments.</p>

<p>111:2. His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the
righteous shall be blessed.</p>

<p>111:3. Glory and wealth shall be in his house: and his justice remaineth
for ever and ever.</p>

<p>111:4. To the righteous a light is risen up in darkness: he is merciful,
and compassionate and just.</p>

<p>111:5. Acceptable is the man that sheweth mercy and lendeth: he shall
order his words with judgment:</p>

<p>111:6. Because he shall not be moved for ever.</p>

<p>111:7. The just shall be in everlasting remembrance: he shall not fear
the evil hearing. His heart is ready to hope in the Lord:</p>

<p>111:8. His heart is strengthened, he shall not be moved until he look
over his enemies.</p>

<p>111:9. He hath distributed, he hath given to the poor: his justice
remaineth for ever and ever: his horn shall be exalted in glory.</p>

<p>111:10. The wicked shall see, and shall be angry, he shall gnash with
his teeth and pine away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.</p>

of the dunghill:</p>

<p>112:8. That he may place him with princes, with the princes of his
people.</p>

<p>112:9. Who maketh a barren woman to dwell in a house, the joyful mother
of children.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 113</p>

<p>In exitu Israel.</p>

<p>God hath shewn his power in delivering his people: idols are vain. The
Hebrews divide this into two psalms.</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>113:1. When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a
barbarous people:</p>

<p>113:2. Judea was made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.</p>

<p>113:3. The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back.</p>

<p>113:4. The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like the lambs of
the flock. 113:5. What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee: and
thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?</p>

<p>113:6. Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and ye hills, like lambs
of the flock?</p>

<p>113:7. At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved, at the presence
of the God of Jacob:</p>

<p>113:8. Who turned the rock into pools of water, and the stony hill into
fountains of waters.</p>

<p>113:1. Not to us, O Lord, not to us; but to thy name give glory.</p>

<p>113:2. For thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake: lest the Gentiles should
say: Where is their God?</p>

<p>113:3. But our God is in heaven: he hath done all things whatsoever he
would.</p>

<p>113:4. The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold, the works of the
hands of men.</p>

<p>113:5. They have mouths and speak not: they have eyes and see not.</p>

<p>113:6. They have ears and hear not: they have noses and smell not.</p>

<p>113:7. They have hands and feel not: they have feet and walk not:
neither shall they cry out through their throat.</p>

<p>113:8. Let them that make them become like unto them: and all such as
trust in them.</p>

<p>113:9. The house of Israel hath hoped in the Lord: he is their helper
and their protector.</p>

<p>113:10. The house of Aaron hath hoped in the Lord: he is their helper
and their protector.</p>

<p>113:11. They that fear the Lord have hoped in the Lord: he is their
helper and their protector.</p>

<p>113:12. The Lord hath been mindful of us, and hath blessed us. He hath
blessed the house of Israel: he hath blessed the house of Aaron.</p>

<p>113:13. He hath blessed all that fear the Lord, both little and great.</p>

<p>113:14. May the Lord add blessings upon you: upon you, and upon your
children.</p>

<p>113:15. Blessed be you of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</p>

<p>113:16. The heaven of heaven is the Lord's: but the earth he has given
to the children of men.</p>

<p>113:17. The dead shall not praise thee, O Lord: nor any of them that go
down to hell.</p>

<p>113:18. But we that live bless the Lord: from this time now and for
ever.</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>114:1. I have loved, because the Lord will hear the voice of my prayer.</p>

<p>114:2. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me: and in my days I will
call upon him.</p>

<p>114:3. The sorrows of death have compassed me: and the perils of hell
have found me. I met with trouble and sorrow:</p>

<p>114:4. And I called upon the name of the Lord. O Lord, deliver my soul.</p>

<p>114:5. The Lord is merciful and just, and our God sheweth mercy.</p>

<p>114:6. The Lord is the keeper of little ones: I was humbled, and he
delivered me.</p>

<p>114:7. Turn, O my soul, into thy rest: for the Lord hath been bountiful
to thee.</p>

<p>114:8. For he hath delivered my soul from death: my eyes from tears, my
feet from falling.</p>

<p>114:9. I will please the Lord in the land of the living.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 115</p>

<p>Credidi.</p>

<p>This in the Hebrew is joined with the foregoing psalm, and continues to
express the faith and gratitude of the psalmist.</p>

<p>Alleluia. 115:10. I have believed, therefore have I spoken; but I have
been humbled exceedingly.</p>

<p>115:11. I said in my excess: Every man is a liar.</p>

<p>115:12. What shall I render to the Lord, for all the things that he hath
rendered to me?</p>

<p>115:13. I will take the chalice of salvation; and I will call upon the
name of the Lord.</p>

<p>115:14. I will pay my vows to the Lord before all his people:</p>

<p>115:15. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.</p>

<p>115:16. O Lord, for I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of
thy handmaid. Thou hast broken my bonds:</p>

<p>115:17. I will sacrifice to thee the sacrifice of praise, and I will
call upon the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>115:18. I will pay my vows to the Lord in the sight of all his people:</p>

<p>115:19. In the courts of the house of the Lord, in the midst of thee, O
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>117:1. Give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth
for ever.</p>

<p>117:2. Let Israel now say, that he is good: that his mercy endureth for
ever.</p>

<p>117:3. Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p>

enlarged me.</p>

<p>117:6. The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what man can do unto me.</p>

<p>117:7. The Lord is my helper: and I will look over my enemies.</p>

<p>117:8. It is good to confide in the Lord, rather than to have confidence
in man.</p>

<p>117:9. It is good to trust in the Lord, rather than to trust in princes.</p>

<p>117:10. All nations compassed me about; and, in the name of the Lord I
have been revenged on them.</p>

<p>117:11. Surrounding me they compassed me about: and in the name of the
Lord I have been revenged on them.</p>

thorns: and in the name of the Lord I was revenged on them.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 118</p>

<p>Beati immaculati.</p>

<p>Of the excellence of virtue consisting in the love and observance of the
commandments of God.</p>

<p>Alleluia.</p>

<p>ALEPH.</p>

<p>Aleph... The first eight verses of this psalm in the original begin with
Aleph, which is the name of the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The
second eight verses begin with Beth, the name of the second letter of
the Hebrew alphabet; and so to the end of the whole alphabet, in all
twenty-two letters, each letter having eight verses. This order is
variously expounded by the holy fathers; which shews the difficulty of
understanding the holy scriptures, and consequently with what humility,
and submission to the Church they are to be read.</p>

<p>118:1. Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the
Lord.</p>

<p>118:2. Blessed are they that search his testimonies: that seek him with
their whole heart.</p>

<p>His testimonies... The commandments of God are called his testimonies,
because they testify his holy will unto us. Note here, that in almost
every verse of this psalm (which in number are 176) the word and law of
God, and the love and observance of it, is perpetually inculcated, under
a variety of denominations, all signifying the same thing.</p>

<p>118:3. For they that work iniquity, have not walked in his ways.</p>

<p>118:4. Thou hast commanded thy commandments to be kept most diligently.</p>

<p>118:5. O! that my ways may be directed to keep thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:6. Then shall I not be confounded, when I shall look into all thy
commandments.</p>

<p>118:7. I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have
learned the judgments of thy justice.</p>

<p>118:8. I will keep thy justifications: O! do not thou utterly forsake
me.</p>

<p>BETH.</p>

<p>
118:9. By what doth a young man correct his way? by observing thy words.</p>

<p>118:10. With my whole heart have I sought after thee: let me not stray
from thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:11. Thy words have I hidden in my heart, that I may not sin against
thee.</p>

<p>118:12. Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:13. With my lips I have pronounced all the judgments of thy mouth.</p>

<p>118:14. I have been delighted in the way of thy testimonies, as in all
riches.</p>

<p>118:15. I will meditate on thy commandments: and I will consider thy
ways.</p>

<p>118:16. I will think of thy justifications: I will not forget thy words.</p>

<p>GIMEL.</p>

<p>118:17. Give bountifully to thy servant, enliven me: and I shall keep
thy words.</p>

<p>118:18. Open thou my eyes: and I will consider the wondrous things of
thy law.</p>

<p>118:19. I am a sojourner on the earth: hide not thy commandments from
me.</p>

<p>118:20. My soul hath coveted to long for thy justifications, at all
times.</p>

<p>118:21. Thou hast rebuked the proud: they are cursed who decline from
thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:22. Remove from me reproach and contempt: because I have sought
after thy testimonies.</p>

<p>118:23. For princes sat, and spoke against me: but thy servant was
employed in thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:24. For thy testimonies are my meditation: and thy justifications my
counsel.</p>

<p>DALETH.</p>

<p>118:25. My soul hath cleaved to the pavement: quicken thou me according
to thy word.</p>

<p>118:26. I have declared my ways, and thou hast heard me: teach me thy
justifications.</p>

<p>118:27. Make me to understand the way of thy justifications: and I shall
be exercised in thy wondrous works.</p>

<p>118:28. My soul hath slumbered through heaviness: strengthen thou me in
thy words.</p>

<p>118:29. Remove from me the way of iniquity: and out of thy law have
mercy on me.</p>

<p>118:30. I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments I have not
forgotten.</p>

<p>118:31. I have stuck to thy testimonies, O Lord: put me not to shame.</p>

<p>118:32. I have run the way of thy commandments, when thou didst enlarge
my heart.</p>

<p>HE.</p>

<p>118:33. Set before me for a law the way of thy justifications, O Lord:
and I will always seek after it.</p>

<p>118:34. Give me understanding, and I will search thy law; and I will
keep it with my whole heart.</p>

<p>118:35. Lead me into the path of thy commandments; for this same I have
desired.</p>

<p>118:36. Incline my heart into thy testimonies and not to covetousness.</p>

<p>118:37. Turn away my eyes that they may not behold vanity: quicken me in
thy way.</p>

<p>118:38. Establish thy word to thy servant, in thy fear.</p>

<p>118:39. Turn away my reproach, which I have apprehended: for thy
judgments are delightful.</p>

<p>118:40. Behold I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy
justice.</p>

<p>VAU.</p>

<p>118: 41. Let thy mercy also come upon me, O Lord: thy salvation
according to thy word.</p>

<p>118:42. So shall I answer them that reproach me in any thing; that I
have trusted in thy words.</p>

<p>118:43. And take not thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth: for
in thy words, I have hoped exceedingly.</p>

<p>118:44. So shall I always keep thy law, for ever and ever.</p>

<p>118:45. And I walked at large: because I have sought after thy
commandments.</p>

<p>118:46. And I spoke of thy testimonies before kings: and I was not
ashamed.</p>

<p>118:47. I meditated also on thy commandments, which I loved.</p>

<p>118:48. And I lifted up my hands to thy commandments, which I loved: and
I was exercised in thy justifications.</p>

<p>ZAIN.</p>

<p>
118:49. Be thou mindful of thy word to thy servant, in which thou hast
given me hope.</p>

<p>118:50. This hath comforted me in my humiliation: because thy word hath
enlivened me.</p>

<p>118:51. The proud did iniquitously altogether: but I declined not from
thy law.</p>

<p>118:52. I remembered, O Lord, thy judgments of old: and I was comforted.</p>

<p>118:53. A fainting hath taken hold of me, because of the wicked that
forsake thy law.</p>

<p>118:54. Thy justifications were the subject of my song, in the place of
my pilgrimage.</p>

<p>118:55. In the night I have remembered thy name, O Lord: and have kept
thy law.</p>

<p>118:56. This happened to me: because I sought after thy justifications.</p>

<p>HETH.</p>

<p>118:57. O Lord, my portion, I have said, I would keep thy law.</p>

<p>118:58. I entreated thy face with all my heart: have mercy on me
according to thy word.</p>

<p>118:59. I have thought on my ways: and turned my feet unto thy
testimonies.</p>

<p>118:60. I am ready, and am not troubled: that I may keep thy
commandments.</p>

<p>118:61. The cords of the wicked have encompassed me: but I have not
forgotten thy law.</p>

commandments.</p>

<p>118:64. The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy
justifications.</p>

<p>TETH.</p>

<p>
118:65. Thou hast done well with thy servant, O Lord, according to thy
word.</p>

<p>118:66. Teach me goodness and discipline and knowledge; for I have
believed thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:67. Before I was humbled I offended; therefore have I kept thy word.</p>

<p>118:68. Thou art good; and in thy goodness teach me thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:69. The iniquity of the proud hath been multiplied over me: but I
will seek thy commandments with my whole heart.</p>

<p>118:70. Their heart is curdled like milk: but I have meditated on thy
law.</p>

<p>118:71. It is good for me that thou hast humbled me, that I may learn
thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:72. The law of thy mouth is good to me, above thousands of gold and
silver.</p>

<p>JOD.</p>

<p>
118:73. Thy hands have made me and formed me: give me understanding, and
I will learn thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:74. They that fear thee shall see me, and shall be glad: because I
have greatly hoped in thy words.</p>

<p>118:75. I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are equity: and in thy truth
thou hast humbled me.</p>

<p>118:76. O! let thy mercy be for my comfort, according to thy word unto
thy servant.</p>

<p>118:77. Let thy tender mercies come unto me, and I shall live: for thy
law is my meditation.</p>

<p>118:78. Let the proud be ashamed, because they have done unjustly
towards me: but I will be employed in thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:79. Let them that fear thee turn to me: and they that know thy
testimonies.</p>

<p>118:80. Let my heart be undefiled in thy justifications, that I may not
be confounded.</p>

<p>CAPH.</p>

<p>
118:81. My soul hath fainted after thy salvation: and in thy word I have
very much hoped.</p>

<p>118:82. My eyes have failed for thy word, saying: When wilt thou comfort
me?</p>

<p>118:83. For I am become like a bottle in the frost: I have not forgotten
thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:84. How many are the days of thy servant: when wilt thou execute
judgment on them that persecute me?</p>

<p>118:85. The wicked have told me fables: but not as thy law.</p>

<p>118:86. All thy statutes are truth: they have persecuted me unjustly, do
thou help me.</p>

<p>118:87. They had almost made an end of me upon earth: but I have not
forsaken thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:88. Quicken thou me according to thy mercy: and I shall keep the
testimonies of thy mouth.</p>

<p>LAMED.</p>

<p>118:89. For ever, O Lord, thy word standeth firm in heaven.</p>

<p>118:90. Thy truth unto all generations: thou hast founded the earth, and
it continueth.</p>

<p>118:91. By thy ordinance the day goeth on: for all things serve thee.</p>

<p>118:92. Unless thy law had been my meditation, I had then perhaps
perished in my abjection.</p>

<p>118:93. Thy justifications I will never forget: for by them thou hast
given me life.</p>

<p>118:94. I am thine, save thou me: for I have sought thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:95. The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I have
understood thy testimonies.</p>

<p>118:96. I have seen an end of all perfection: thy commandment is
exceeding broad.</p>

<p>MEM.</p>

<p>118:97. O how have I loved thy law, O Lord! it is my meditation all the
day.</p>

<p>118:98. Through thy commandment, thou hast made me wiser than my
enemies: for it is ever with me.</p>

<p>118:99. I have understood more than all my teachers: because thy
testimonies are my meditation.</p>

<p>118:100. I have had understanding above ancients: because I have sought
thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:101. I have restrained my feet from every evil way: that I may keep
thy words.</p>

<p>118:102. I have not declined from thy judgments, because thou hast set
me a law.</p>

<p>118:103. How sweet are thy words to my palate! more than honey to my
mouth.</p>

<p>118:104. By thy commandments I have had understanding: therefore have I
hated every way of iniquity.</p>

<p>NUN.</p>

<p>118:105. Thy word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my paths.</p>

<p>118:106. I have sworn and am determined to keep the judgments of thy
justice.</p>

<p>118:107. I have been humbled, O Lord, exceedingly: quicken thou me
according to thy word.</p>

<p>118:108. The free offerings of my mouth make acceptable, O Lord: and
teach me thy judgments.</p>

<p>118:109. My soul is continually in my hands: and I have not forgotten
thy law.</p>

<p>118:110. Sinners have laid a snare for me: but I have not erred from thy
precepts.</p>

<p>118:111. I have purchased thy testimonies for an inheritance for ever:
because they are the joy of my heart.</p>

<p>118:112. I have inclined my heart to do thy justifications for ever, for
the reward.</p>

<p>SAMECH.</p>

<p>
118:113. I have hated the unjust: and have loved thy law.</p>

<p>118:114. Thou art my helper and my protector: and in thy word I have
greatly hoped.</p>

<p>118:115. Depart from me, ye malignant: and I will search the
commandments of my God.</p>

<p>118:116. Uphold me according to thy word, and I shall live: and let me
not be confounded in my expectation.</p>

<p>118:117. Help me, and I shall be saved: and I will meditate always on
thy justifications.</p>

<p>118:118. Thou hast despised all them that fall off from thy judgments;
for their thought is unjust.</p>

<p>118:119. I have accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators:
therefore have I loved thy testimonies.</p>

<p>118:120. Pierce thou my flesh with thy fear: for I am afraid of thy
judgments.</p>

<p>AIN.</p>

<p>118:121. I have done judgment and justice: give me not up to them that
slander me.</p>

<p>118:122. Uphold thy servant unto good: let not the proud calumniate me.</p>

<p>118:123. My eyes have fainted after thy salvation: and for the word of
thy justice.</p>

<p>118:124. Deal with thy servant according to thy mercy: and teach me thy
justifications.</p>

<p>118:125. I am thy servant: give me understanding that I may know thy
testimonies.</p>

<p>118:126. It is time, O Lord, to do: they have dissipated thy law.</p>

<p>118:127. Therefore have I loved thy commandments above gold and the
topaz.</p>

<p>118:128. Therefore was I directed to all thy commandments: I have hated
all wicked ways.</p>

<p>PHE.</p>

<p>
118:129. Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore my soul hath sought
them.</p>

<p>118:130. The declaration of thy words giveth light: and giveth
understanding to little ones.</p>

<p>118:131. I opened my mouth, and panted: because I longed for thy
commandments.</p>

<p>118:132. Look thou upon me, and have mercy on me according to the
judgment of them that love thy name.</p>

<p>118:133. Direct my steps according to thy word: and let no iniquity have
dominion over me.</p>

<p>118:134. Redeem me from the calumnies of men: that I may keep thy
commandments.</p>

<p>118:135. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: and teach me thy
justifications.</p>

<p>118:136. My eyes have sent forth springs of water: because they have not
kept thy law.</p>

<p>SADE.</p>

<p>118:137. Thou art just, O Lord: and thy judgment is right.</p>

<p>118:138. Thou hast commanded justice thy testimonies: and thy truth
exceedingly.</p>

<p>118:139. My zeal hath made me pine away: because my enemies forgot thy
words.</p>

<p>118:140. Thy word is exceedingly refined: and thy servant hath loved it.</p>

<p>118:141. I am very young and despised; but I forget not thy
justifications.</p>

<p>118:142. Thy justice is justice for ever: and thy law is the truth.</p>

<p>118:143. Trouble and anguish have found me: thy commandments are my
meditation.</p>

<p>118:144. Thy testimonies are justice for ever: give me understanding,
and I shall live.</p>

<p>COPH.</p>

<p>118:145. I cried with my whole heart, hear me, O Lord: I will seek thy
justifications.</p>

<p>118:146. I cried unto thee, save me: that I may keep thy commandments.</p>

<p>118:147. I prevented the dawning of the day, and cried: because in thy
words I very much hoped.</p>

<p>118:148. My eyes to thee have prevented the morning: that I might
meditate on thy words.</p>

<p>118:149. Hear thou my voice, O Lord, according to thy mercy: and quicken
me according to thy judgment.</p>

<p>118:150. They that persecute me have drawn nigh to iniquity; but they
are gone far off from thy law.</p>

<p>118:151. Thou art near, O Lord: and all thy ways are truth.</p>

<p>118:152. I have known from the beginning concerning thy testimonies:
that thou hast founded them for ever.</p>

<p>RES.</p>

<p>118:153. See my humiliation and deliver me for I have not forgotten thy
law.</p>

<p>118:154. Judge my judgment and redeem me: quicken thou me for thy word's
sake.</p>

<p>118:155. Salvation is far from sinners; because they have not sought thy
justifications.</p>

<p>118:156. Many, O Lord, are thy mercies: quicken me according to thy
judgment.</p>

<p>118:157. Many are they that persecute me and afflict me; but I have not
declined from thy testimonies.</p>

<p>118:158. I beheld the transgressors, and pined away; because they kept
not thy word.</p>

<p>118:159. Behold I have loved thy commandments, O Lord; quicken me thou
in thy mercy.</p>

<p>118:160. The beginning of thy words is truth: all the judgments of thy
justice are for ever.</p>

<p>SIN.</p>

<p>118:161. Princes have persecuted me without cause: and my heart hath
been in awe of thy words.</p>

<p>118:162. I will rejoice at thy words, as one that hath found great
spoil.</p>

<p>118:163. I have hated and abhorred iniquity; but I have loved thy law.</p>

<p>118:164. Seven times a day I have given praise to thee, for the
judgments of thy justice.</p>

<p>118:165. Much peace have they that love thy law, and to them there is no
stumbling block.</p>

<p>118:166. I looked for thy salvation, O Lord: and I loved thy
commandments.</p>

<p>118:167. My soul hath kept thy testimonies and hath loved them
exceedingly.</p>

<p>118:168. I have kept thy commandments and thy testimonies: because all
my ways are in thy sight.</p>

<p>TAU.</p>

<p>118:169. Let my supplication, O Lord, come near in thy sight: give me
understanding according to thy word.</p>

<p>118:170. Let my request come in before thee; deliver thou me according
to thy word.</p>

<p>118:171. My lips shall utter a hymn, when thou shalt teach me thy
justifications.</p>

<p>118:172. My tongue shall pronounce thy word: because all thy
commandments are justice.</p>

<p>118:173. Let thy hand be with me to save me; for I have chosen thy
precepts.</p>

<p>118:174. I have longed for thy salvation, O Lord; and thy law is my
meditation.</p>

<p>118:175. My soul shall live and shall praise thee: and thy judgments
shall help me.</p>

<p>118:176. I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost: seek thy servant,
because I have not forgotten thy commandments.</p>

<p>Ad Dominum.</p>

<p>A prayer in tribulation.</p>

<p>A gradual canticle.</p>

<p>A gradual canticle... The following psalms, in number fifteen, are
called gradual psalms, or canticles, from the word gradus, signifying
steps, ascensions, or degrees: either because they were appointed to be
sung on the fifteen steps, by which the people ascended to the temple:
or, that in the singing of them the voice was to be raised by certain
steps or ascensions: or, that they were to be sung by the people
returning from their captivity and ascending to Jerusalem, which was
seated amongst mountains. The holy fathers, in a mystical sense,
understand these steps, or ascensions, of the degrees by which
Christians spiritually ascend to virtue and perfection; and to the true
temple of God in the heavenly Jerusalem.</p>

<p>119:1. In my trouble I cried to the Lord: and he heard me.</p>

<p>119:2. O Lord, deliver my soul from wicked lips, and a deceitful tongue.</p>

<p>119:3. What shall be given to thee, or what shall be added to thee, to a
deceitful tongue?</p>

<p>119:4. The sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals that lay waste.</p>

<p>119:5. Woe is me, that my sojourning is prolonged! I have dwelt with the
inhabitants of Cedar:</p>

<p>119:6. My soul hath been long a sojourner.</p>

<p>119:7. With them that hated peace I was peaceable: when I spoke to them
they fought against me without cause.</p>

hand.</p>

<p>120:6. The sun shall not burn thee by day: nor the moon by night.</p>

house of the Lord.</p>

<p>121:2. Our feet were standing in thy courts, O Jerusalem.</p>

<p>121:3. Jerusalem, which is built as a city, which is compact together.</p>

<p>121:4. For thither did the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord: the
testimony of Israel, to praise the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>121:5. Because their seats have sat in judgment, seats upon the house of
David.</p>

<p>121:6. Pray ye for the things that are for the peace of Jerusalem: and
abundance for them that love thee.</p>

<p>121:7. Let peace be in thy strength: and abundance in thy towers.</p>

<p>121:8. For the sake of my brethren, and of my neighbours, I spoke peace
of thee.</p>

As the eyes of the handmaid are on the hands of her mistress: so are our
eyes unto the Lord our God, until he have mercy on us.</p>

and contempt to the proud.</p>

<p>123:2. If it had not been that the Lord was with us, When men rose up
against us,</p>

<p>123:3. Perhaps they had swallowed us up alive. When their fury was
enkindled against us,</p>

<p>123:4. Perhaps the waters had swallowed us up.</p>

<p>123:5. Our soul hath passed through a torrent: perhaps our soul had
passed through a water insupportable.</p>

<p>123:6. Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us to be a prey to their
teeth.</p>

<p>123:7. Our soul hath been delivered as a sparrow out of the snare of the
fowlers. The snare is broken, and we are delivered.</p>

<p>124:3. For the Lord will not leave the rod of sinners upon the lot of
the just: that the just may not stretch forth their hands to iniquity.</p>

for them.</p>

<p>125:3. The Lord hath done great things for us: we are become joyful.</p>

<p>125:4. Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as a stream in the south.</p>

<p>125:5. They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</p>

<p>Nothing can be done without God's grace and blessing.</p>

sitten, you that eat the bread of sorrow. When he shall give sleep to
his beloved,</p>

<p>It is vain for you to rise before light... That is, your early rising,
your labour and worldly solicitude, will be vain, that is, will avail
you nothing, without the light, grace, and blessing of God.</p>

not prevail over me.</p>

iniquity.</p>

<p>128:4. The Lord who is just will cut the necks of sinners:</p>

<p>128:5. Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Sion.</p>

<p>128:6. Let them be as grass upon the tops of houses: which withereth
before it be plucked up:</p>

<p>128:7. Who with the mower filleth not his hand: nor he that gathereth
sheaves his bosom.</p>

be upon you: we have blessed you in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>131:3. If I shall enter into the tabernacle of my house: if I shall go
up into the bed wherein I lie:</p>

<p>131:4. If I shall give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids,</p>

<p>131:5. Or rest to my temples: until I find out a place for the Lord, a
tabernacle for the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>131:6. Behold we have heard of it in Ephrata: we have found it in the
fields of the wood.</p>

<p>We have heard of it in Ephrata... When I was young, and lived in
Bethlehem, otherwise called Ephrata, I heard of God's tabernacle and
ark, and had a devout desire of seeking it; and accordingly I found it
at Cariathiarim, the city of the woods: where it was till it was removed
to Jerusalem. See 1 Par. 13.</p>

<p>131:7. We will go into his tabernacle: we will adore in the place where
his feet stood.</p>

<p>131:8. Arise, O Lord, into thy resting place: thou and the ark, which
thou hast sanctified.</p>

<p>131:9. Let thy priests be clothed with justice: and let thy saints
rejoice.</p>

<p>131:10. For thy servant David's sake, turn not away the face of thy
anointed.</p>

<p>131:11. The Lord hath sworn truth to David, and he will not make it
void: of the fruit of thy womb I will set upon thy throne.</p>

<p>131:12. If thy children will keep my covenant, and these my testimonies
which I shall teach them: Their children also for evermore shall sit
upon thy throne.</p>

<p>131:13. For the Lord hath chosen Sion: he hath chosen it for his
dwelling.</p>

<p>131:14. This is my rest for ever and ever: here will I dwell, for I have
chosen it.</p>

<p>131:15. Blessing I will bless her widow: I will satisfy her poor with
bread.</p>

for my anointed.</p>

sanctification flourish.</p>

lightnings for the rain. He bringeth forth winds out of his stores:</p>

<p>134:8. He slew the firstborn of Egypt from man even unto beast.</p>

<p>134:9. He sent forth signs and wonders in the midst of thee, O Egypt:
upon Pharao, and upon all his servants.</p>

kingdoms of Chanaan.</p>

<p>134:12. And gave their land for an inheritance, for an inheritance to

see not.</p>

<p>134:17. They have ears, but they hear not: neither is there any breath
in their mouths.</p>

trusteth in them.</p>

<p>Super flumina.</p>

<p>The lamentation of the people of God in their captivity in Babylon.</p>

<p>A psalm of David, for Jeremias.</p>

<p>For Jeremias... For the time of Jeremias, and the captivity of Babylon.</p>

<p>136:1. Upon the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept: when we
remembered Sion:</p>

<p>136:2. On the willows in the midst thereof we hung up our instruments.</p>

<p>136:3. For there they that led us into captivity required of us the
words of songs. And they that carried us away, said: Sing ye to us a
hymn of the songs of Sion.</p>

<p>136:4. How shall we sing the song of the Lord in a strange land?</p>

<p>136:5. If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten.</p>

<p>136:6. Let my tongue cleave to my jaws, if I do not remember thee: If I
make not Jerusalem the beginning of my joy.</p>

<p>136:7. Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom, in the day of Jerusalem:
Who say: Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.</p>

<p>136:8. O daughter of Babylon, miserable: blessed shall he be who shall
repay thee thy payment which thou hast paid us.</p>

<p>136:9. Blessed be he that shall take and dash thy little ones against
the rock.</p>

<p>Dash thy little ones, etc... In the spiritual sense, we dash the little
ones of Babylon against the rock, when we mortify our passions, and
stifle the first motions of them, by a speedy recourse to the rock which
is Christ.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 137</p>

<p>Confitebor tibi.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving to God for his benefits.</p>

<p>137:1. For David himself. I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole
heart: for thou hast heard the words of my mouth. I will sing praise to
thee in the sight of the angels:</p>

<p>137:2. I will worship towards thy holy temple, and I will give glory to
thy name. For thy mercy, and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy
holy name above all.</p>

<p>137:3. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear me: thou shalt
multiply strength in my soul.</p>

<p>137:4. May all the kings of the earth give glory to thee: for they have
heard all the words of thy mouth.</p>

of the Lord.</p>

<p>137:6. For the Lord is high, and looketh on the low: and the high he
knoweth afar off.</p>

<p>137:7. If I shall walk in the midst of tribulation, thou wilt quicken
me: and thou hast stretched forth thy hand against the wrath of my
enemies: and thy right hand hath saved me.</p>

<p>137:8. The Lord will repay for me: thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever:
O despise not the works of thy hands.</p>

<p>Domine, probasti.</p>

<p>God's special providence over his servants.</p>

<p>138:1. Unto the end, a psalm of David. Lord, thou hast proved me, and
known me:</p>

<p>138:2. Thou hast known my sitting down, and my rising up.</p>

<p>138:3. Thou hast understood my thoughts afar off: my path and my line
thou hast searched out.</p>

<p>138:4. And thou hast foreseen all my ways: for there is no speech in my
tongue.</p>

<p>There is no speech, etc... Viz., unknown to thee: or when there is no
speech in my tongue; yet my whole interior and my most secret thoughts
are known to thee.</p>

<p>138:5. Behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things, the last and those of
old: thou hast formed me, and hast laid thy hand upon me.</p>

<p>138:6. Thy knowledge is become wonderful to me: it is high, and I cannot
reach to it.</p>

<p>138:7. Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from
thy face?</p>

<p>138:8 &nbsp;If I ascend into heaven, thou art there: if I descend into hell,
thou art present.</p>

<p>138:9. If I take my wings early in the morning, and dwell in the
uttermost parts of the sea:</p>

<p>138:10. Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall
hold me.</p>

<p>138:11. And I said: Perhaps darkness shall cover me: and night shall be
my light in my pleasures.</p>

<p>138:12. But darkness shall not be dark to thee, and night shall be light
all the day: the darkness thereof, and the light thereof are alike to
thee.</p>

<p>138:13. For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast protected me from my
mother's womb.</p>

<p>138:14. I will praise thee, for thou art fearfully magnified: wonderful
are thy works, and my soul knoweth right well.</p>

<p>138:15. My bone is not hidden from thee, which thou hast made in secret:
and my substance in the lower parts of the earth.</p>

<p>138:16. Thy eyes did see my imperfect being, and in thy book all shall
be written: days shall be formed, and no one in them.</p>

<p>138:17. But to me thy friends, O God, are made exceedingly honourable:
their principality is exceedingly strengthened.</p>

<p>138:18. I will number them, and they shall be multiplied above the sand,
I rose up and am still with thee.</p>

<p>138:19. If thou wilt kill the wicked, O God: ye men of blood, depart
from me:</p>

<p>138:20. Because you say in thought: They shall receive thy cities in
vain.</p>

<p>Because you say in thought, etc... Depart from me, you wicked, who plot
against the servants of God, and think to cast them out of the cities of
their habitation; as if they have received them in vain, and to no
purpose.</p>

<p>138:21. Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hated thee: and pined away
because of thy enemies?</p>

<p>138:22. I have hated them with a perfect hatred: and they are become
enemies to me.</p>

<p>I have hated them... Not with an hatred of malice, but a zeal for the
observance of God's commandments; which he saw were despised by the
wicked, who are to be considered enemies to God.</p>

<p>138:23. Prove me, O God, and know my heart: examine me, and know my
paths.</p>

<p>138:24. And see if there be in me the way of iniquity: and lead me in
the eternal way.</p>

<p>Eripe me, Domine.</p>

<p>A prayer to be delivered from the wicked.</p>

<p>139:1. Unto the end, a psalm of David.</p>

<p>139:2. Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man: rescue me from the unjust
man.</p>

<p>139:3. Who have devised iniquities in their hearts: all the day long
they designed battles.</p>

<p>139:4. They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: the venom of
asps is under their lips.</p>

<p>139:5. Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the wicked: and from unjust men
deliver me. Who have proposed to supplant my steps:</p>

<p>139:6. The proud have hidden a net for me. And they have stretched out
cords for a snare: they have laid for me a stumblingblock by the
wayside.</p>

<p>139:7. I said to the Lord: Thou art my God: hear, O Lord, the voice of
my supplication.</p>

<p>139:8. O Lord, Lord, the strength of my salvation: thou hast
overshadowed my head in the day of battle.</p>

<p>139:9. Give me not up, O Lord, from my desire to the wicked: they have
plotted against me; do not thou forsake me, lest they should triumph.</p>

<p>139:10. The head of them compassing me about: the labour of their lips
shall overwhelm them.</p>

<p>139:11. Burning coals shall fall upon them; thou wilt cast them down
into the fire: in miseries they shall not be able to stand.</p>

<p>139:12. A man full of tongue shall not be established in the earth: evil
shall catch the unjust man unto destruction.</p>

<p>139:13. I know that the Lord will do justice to the needy, and will
revenge the poor.</p>

<p>139:14. But as for the just, they shall give glory to thy name: and the
upright shall dwell with thy countenance.</p>

<p>Psalms Chapter 140</p>

<p>Domine, clamavi.</p>

<p>A prayer against sinful words, and deceitful flatterers.</p>

<p>A psalm of David.</p>

<p>140:1. I have cried to thee, O Lord, hear me: hearken to my voice, when
I cry to thee.</p>

<p>140:2. Let my prayer be directed as incense in thy sight; the lifting up
of my hands, as evening sacrifice.</p>

<p>140:3. Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and a door round about my
lips.</p>

<p>140:4. Incline not my heart to evil words; to make excuses in sins. With
men that work iniquity: and I will not communicate with the choicest of
them.</p>

<p>140:5. The just man shall correct me in mercy, and shall reprove me: but
let not the oil of the sinner fatten my head. For my prayer shall still
be against the things with which they are well pleased:</p>

<p>Let not the oil of the sinner, etc... That is, the flattery, or
deceitful praise.-Ibid. For my prayer, etc... So far from coveting their
praises, who are never well pleased but with things that are evil; I
shall continually pray to be preserved from such things as they are
delighted with.</p>

<p>140:6. Their judges falling upon the rock have been swallowed up. They
shall hear my words, for they have prevailed:</p>

<p>Their judges, etc... Their rulers, or chiefs, quickly vanish and perish,
like ships dashed against the rocks, and swallowed up by the waves. Let
them then hear my words, for they are powerful and will prevail; or, as
it is in the Hebrew, for they are sweet.</p>

<p>140:7. As when the thickness of the earth is broken up upon the ground:
Our bones are scattered by the side of hell.</p>

<p>140:8. But to thee, O Lord, Lord, are my eyes: in thee have I put my
trust, take not away my soul.</p>

<p>140:9. Keep me from the snare, which they have laid for me, and from the
stumblingblocks of them that work iniquity.</p>

<p>140:10. The wicked shall fall in his net: I am alone until I pass.</p>

<p>I am alone, etc... Singularly protected by the Almighty, until I pass
all their nets and snares.</p>

<p>141:2. I cried to the Lord with my voice: with my voice I made
supplication to the Lord.</p>

<p>141:3. In his sight I pour out my prayer, and before him I declare my
trouble:</p>

<p>141:4. When my spirit failed me, then thou knewest my paths. In this way
wherein I walked, they have hidden a snare for me.</p>

<p>141:5. I looked on my right hand, and beheld, and there was no one that
would know me. Flight hath failed me: and there is no one that hath
regard to my soul.</p>

<p>141:6. I cried to thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my hope, my portion in
the land of the living.</p>

<p>141:7. Attend to my supplication: for I am brought very low. Deliver me
from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.</p>

<p>141:8. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the just
wait for me, until thou reward me.</p>

Hear, O Lord, my prayer: give ear to my supplication in thy truth: hear
me in thy justice.</p>

<p>142:2. And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight no
man living shall be justified.</p>

<p>142:3. For the enemy hath persecuted my soul: he hath brought down my
life to the earth. He hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that
have been dead of old:</p>

<p>142:4 &nbsp;And my spirit is in anguish within me: my heart within me is
troubled.</p>

<p>142:5. I remembered the days of old, I meditated on all thy works: I
meditated upon the works of thy hands.</p>

<p>142:6. I stretched forth my hands to thee: my soul is as earth without
water unto thee.</p>

<p>142:7. Hear me speedily, O Lord: my spirit hath fainted away. Turn not
away thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the
pit.</p>

<p>142:8. Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning; for in thee have I
hoped. Make the way known to me, wherein I should walk: for I have
lifted up my soul to thee.</p>

<p>142:9. Deliver me from my enemies, O Lord, to thee have I fled:</p>

<p>142:10. Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God. Thy good spirit
shall lead me into the right land: &nbsp;&nbsp;11 &nbsp;for thy name's sake, O Lord,
thou wilt quicken me in thy justice. Thou wilt bring my soul out of
trouble:</p>

<p>142:12. And in thy mercy thou wilt destroy my enemies. And thou wilt cut
off all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.</p>

<p>143:1. Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hands to fight, and
my fingers to war.</p>

<p>143:2. My mercy, and my refuge: my support, and my deliverer: My
protector, and I have hoped in him: who subdueth my people under me.</p>

<p>143:3. Lord, what is man, that thou art made known to him? or the son of
man, that thou makest account of him?</p>

<p>143:4. Man is like to vanity: his days pass away like a shadow.</p>

<p>143:5. Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend: touch the mountains, and
they shall smoke.</p>

<p>143:6. Send forth lightning, and thou shalt scatter them: shoot out thy
arrows, and thou shalt trouble them.</p>

<p>143:7. Put forth thy hand from on high, take me out, and deliver me from
many waters: from the hand of strange children:</p>

<p>143:8. Whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right
hand of iniquity.</p>

<p>143:9. To thee, O God, I will sing a new canticle: on the psaltery and
an instrument of ten strings I will sing praises to thee.</p>

<p>143:10. Who givest salvation to kings: who hast redeemed thy servant
David from the malicious sword:</p>

<p>143:11. Deliver me, And rescue me out of the hand of strange children;
whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand
of iniquity:</p>

<p>143:12. Whose sons are as new plants in their youth: Their daughters
decked out, adorned round about after the similitude of a temple:</p>

<p>143:13. Their storehouses full, flowing out of this into that. Their
sheep fruitful in young, abounding in their goings forth:</p>

<p>143:14. Their oxen fat. There is no &nbsp;breach of wall, nor passage, nor
crying out in their streets.</p>

<p>143:15. They have called the people happy, that hath these things: but
happy is that people whose God is the Lord.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
