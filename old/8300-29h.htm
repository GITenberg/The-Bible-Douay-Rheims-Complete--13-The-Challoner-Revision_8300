<p>THE LAMENTATIONS OF JEREMIAS</p>

<p>In these JEREMIAS laments in a most pathetical manner the miseries of
his people, and the destruction of JERUSALEM and the temple, in Hebrew
verses, beginning with different letters according to the order of the
Hebrew alphabet.</p>

<p>
Lamentations Chapter 1</p>

<p>PREFACE: And it came to pass, after Israel was carried into captivity,
and Jerusalem was desolate, that Jeremias the prophet sat weeping, and
mourned with this lamentation over Jerusalem, and with a sorrowful mind,
sighing and moaning, he said:</p>

<p>And it came to pass, etc... This preface was not written by Jeremias,
but was added by the seventy interpreters, to give the reader to
understand upon what occasion the Lamentations were published.</p>

<p>1:1. Aleph. How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people! how
is the mistress of the Gentiles become as a widow: the princes of
provinces made tributary!</p>

<p>1:2. Beth. Weeping, she hath wept in the night, and her tears are on her
cheeks: there is none to comfort her among all them that were dear to
her: all her friends have despised her, and are become her enemies.</p>

<p>1:3. Ghimel. Juda hath removed her dwelling place, because of her
affliction, and the greatness of her bondage; she hath dwelt among the
nations, and she hath found no rest; all her persecutors have taken her
in the midst of straits.</p>

<p>1:4. Daleth. The ways of Sion mourn, because there are none that come to
the solemn feast: all her gates are broken down; her priests sigh; her
virgins are in affliction; and she is oppressed with bitterness. &nbsp;1:5.
He. Her adversaries are become her lords; her enemies are enriched;
because the Lord hath spoken against her for the multitude of her
iniquities; her children are led into captivity, before the face of the
oppressor.</p>

<p>1:6. Vau. And from the daughter of Sion, all her beauty is departed; her
princes are become like rams that find no pastures; and they are gone
away without strength before the face of the pursuer.</p>

<p>1:7. Zain. Jerusalem hath remembered the days of her affliction, and
prevarication of all her desirable things which she had from the days of
old, when her people fell in the enemy's hand, and there was no helper;
the enemies have seen her, and have mocked at her sabbaths.</p>

<p>1:8. Heth. Jerusalem hath grievously sinned, therefore is she become
unstable; all that honoured her, have despised her, because they have
seen her shame; but she sighed, and turned backward.</p>

<p>1:9. Teth. Her filthiness is on her feet, and she hath not remembered
her end; she is wonderfully cast down, not having a comforter: behold, O
Lord, my affliction, because the enemy is lifted up.</p>

<p>1:10. Jod. The enemy hath put out his hand to all her desirable things:
for she hath seen the Gentiles enter into her sanctuary, of whom thou
gavest commandment that they should not enter into thy church.</p>

<p>1:11. Caph. All her people sigh, they seek bread: they have given all
their precious things for food to relieve the soul: see, 0 Lord, and
consider, for I am become vile. 1:12. Lamed. O all ye that pass by the
way, attend, and see if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow: for he
hath made a vintage of me, as the Lord spoke in the day of his fierce
anger.</p>

<p>1:13. Mem. From above he hath sent fire into my bones, and hath
chastised me: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back:
he hath made me desolate, wasted with sorrow all the day long.</p>

<p>1:14. Nun. The yoke of my iniquities hath watched: they are folded
together in his hand, and put upon my neck: my strength is weakened: the
Lord hath delivered me into a hand, out of which I am not able to rise.
1:15. Samech. The Lord hath taken away all my mighty men out of the
midst of me: he hath called against me the time, to destroy my chosen
men: the Lord hath trodden the winepress for the virgin daughter of
Juda.</p>

<p>1:16. Ain. Therefore do I weep, and my eyes run down with water: because
the comforter, the relief of my soul, is far from me: my children are
desolate because the enemy hath prevailed.</p>

<p>1:17. Phe. Sion hath spread forth her hands, there is none to comfort
her: the Lord hath commanded against Jacob, his enemies are round about
him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.</p>

<p>1:18. Sade. The Lord is just, for I have provoked his mouth to wrath:
hear, I pray you, all ye people, and see my sorrow: my virgins, and my
young men are gone into captivity.</p>

<p>1:19. Coph. I called for my friends, but they deceived me: my priests
and my ancients pined away in the city: while they sought their food, to
relieve their souls.</p>

<p>1:20. Res. Behold, 0 Lord, for I am in distress, my bowels are troubled:
my heart is turned within me, for I am full of bitterness: abroad the
sword destroyeth and at home there is death alike.</p>

<p>1:21. Sin. They have heard that I sigh, and there is none to comfort me:
all my enemies have heard of my evil, they have rejoiced that thou hast
done it: thou hast brought a day of consolation, and they shall be like
unto me.</p>

<p>1:22. Thau. Let all their evil be present before thee: and make vintage
of them, as thou hast made vintage of me for all my iniquities: for my
sighs are many, and my heart is sorrowful.</p>

<p>Lamentations Chapter 2</p>

<p>2:1. Aleph. How hath the Lord covered with obscurity the daughter of
Sion in his wrath! how hath he cast down from heaven to the earth the
glorious one of Israel, and hath not remembered his footstool in the day
of his anger.</p>

<p>2:2. Beth. The Lord hath cast down headlong, and hath not spared, all
that was beautiful in Jacob: he hath destroyed in his wrath the strong
holds of the virgin of Juda, and brought them down to the ground: he
hath made the kingdom unclean, and the princes thereof.</p>

<p>2:3. Ghimel. He hath broken in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel:
he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy: and he hath
kindled in Jacob as it were a flaming fire devouring round about.</p>

<p>2:4. Daleth. He hath bent his bow as an enemy, he hath fixed his right
hand as an adversary: and he hath killed all that was fair to behold in
the tabernacle of the daughter of Sion, he hath poured out his
indignation like fire.</p>

<p>2:5. He. The Lord is become as an enemy: he hath cast down Israel
headlong, he hath overthrown all the walls thereof: he hath destroyed
his strong holds, and hath multiplied in the danghter of Juda the
afflicted, both men and women.</p>

<p>2:6. Vau. And he hath destroyed his tent as a garden, he hath thrown
down his tabernacle: the Lord hath caused feasts and sabbaths to be
forgotten in Sion: and hath delivered up king and priest to reproach,
and to the indignation of his wrath.</p>

<p>2:7. Zain. The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath cursed his
sanctuary: he hath delivered the walls of the towers thereof into the
hand of the enemy: they have made a noise in the house of the Lord, as
in the day of a solemn feast.</p>

<p>He hath cursed his sanctuary... That is, he permitted his sanctuary to
be destroyed, as if it had not been consecrated, but execrable.</p>

<p>2:8. Heth. The Lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of
Sion: he hath stretched out his line, and hath not withdrawn his hand
from destroying: and the bulwark hath mourned, and the wall hath been
destroyed together.</p>

<p>2:9. Teth. Her gates are sunk into the ground: he hath destroyed, and
broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the
law is no more, and her prophets have found no vision from the Lord.</p>

<p>2:10. Jod. The ancients of the daughter of Sion sit upon the ground,
they have held their peace: they have sprinkled their heads with dust,
they are girdcd with haircloth, the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their
heads to the ground.</p>

<p>2:11. Caph. My eyes have failed with weeping, my bowels are troubled: my
liver is poured out upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter
of my people, when the children, and the sucklings, fainted away in the
streets of the city.</p>

<p>2:12. Lamed. They said to their mothers: Where is corn and wine? when
they fainted away as the wounded in the streets of the city: when they
breathed out their souls in the bosoms of their mothers.</p>

<p>2:13. Mem. To what shall I compare thee? or to what shall I liken thee,
O daughter of Jerusalem? to what shall I equal thee, that I may comfort
thee, O virgin daughter of Sion? for great as the sea is thy
destruction: who shall heal thee?</p>

<p>2:14. Nun. Thy prophets have seen false and foolish things for thee: and
they have not laid open thy iniquity, to excite thee to penance: but
they have seen for thee false revelations and banishments.</p>

<p>2:15. Samech. All they that passed by the way have clapped their hands
at thee: they have hissed, and wagged their heads at the daughter of
Jerusalem, saying: Is this the city of perfect beauty, the joy of all
the earth?</p>

<p>2:16. Phe. All thy enemies have opened their month against thee: they
have hissed, and gnashed with the teeth, and have said: We will swallow
her up: lo, this is the day which we looked for: we have found it, we
have seen it.</p>

<p>2:17. Ain. The Lord hath done that which he purposed, he hath fulfilled
his word, which he commanded in the days of old: he hath destroyed, and
hath not spared, and he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee, and
hath set up the horn of thy adversaries.</p>

<p>2:18. Sade. Their heart cried to the Lord upon the walls of the daughter
of Sion: Let tears run down like a torrent day and night: give thyself
no rest, and let not the apple of thy eye cease.</p>

<p>2:19. Coph. Arise, give praise in the night, in the beginning of the
watches: pour out thy heart like water, before the face of the Lord:
lift up thy hands to him for the life of thy little children, that have
fainted for hunger at the top of all the streets.</p>

<p>2:20. Res. Behold, O Lord, and consider whom thou hast thus dealt with:
shall women then eat their own fruit, their children of a span long?
shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?</p>

<p>2:21. Sin. The child and the old man lie without on the ground: my
virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: thou hast slain them
in the day of thy wrath: thou hast killed, and shewn them no pity.</p>

<p>2:22. Thau. Thou hast called as to a festival, those that should terrify
me round about, and there was none in the day of the wrath of the Lord
that escaped and was left: those that I brought up, and nourished, my
enemy hath consumed them.</p>

<p>Lamentations Chapter 3</p>

<p>3:1. Aleph. I am the man that see my poverty by the rod of his
indignation.</p>

<p>3:2. Aleph. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, and not into
light. &nbsp;3:3. Aleph. Only against me he hath turned, and turned again his
hand all the day.</p>

<p>3:4. Beth. My skin and my flesh he hath made old, he hath broken my
bones.</p>

<p>3:5. Beth. He hath built round about me, and he hath compassed me with
gall, and labour.</p>

<p>3:6. Beth. He hath set me in dark places as those that are dead for
ever.</p>

<p>3:7. Ghimel. He hath built against me round about, that I may not get
out: he hath made my fetters heavy.</p>

<p>3:8. Ghimel. Yea, and when I cry, and entreat, he hath shut out my
prayer.</p>

<p>3:9. Ghimel. He hath shut up my ways with square stones, he hath turned
my paths upside down.</p>

<p>3:10. Daleth. He is become to me as a bear lying in wait: as a lion in
secret places.</p>

<p>3:11. Daleth. He hath turned aside my paths, and hath broken me in
pieces, he hath made me desolate.</p>

<p>3:12. Daleth. He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for his arrows.</p>

<p>
3:13. He. He hath shot into my reins the daughters of his quiver.</p>

<p>3:14. He. I am made a derision to all my people, their song all the day
long.</p>

<p>3:15. He. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath inebriated me with
wormwood.</p>

<p>3:16. Vau. And he hath broken my teeth one by one, he hath fed me with
ashes.</p>

<p>3:17. Vau. And my soul is removed far off from peace, I have forgotten
good things.</p>

<p>3:18. Vau. And I said: My end and my hope is perished from the Lord.</p>

<p>3:19. Zain. Remember my poverty, and transgression, the wormwood and the
gall.</p>

<p>3:20. Zain. I will be mindful and remember, and my soul shall languish
within me.</p>

<p>3:21. Zain. These things I shall think over in my heart, therefore will
I hope.</p>

<p>3:22. Heth. The mercies of the Lord that we are not consumed: because
his commiserations have not failed.</p>

<p>3:23. Heth. They are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.</p>

<p>3:24. Heth. The Lord is my portion, said my soul: therefore will I wait
for him.</p>

<p>3:25. Teth. The Lord is good to them that hope in him, to the soul that
seeketh him.</p>

<p>3:26. Teth. It is good to wait with silence for the salvation of God.</p>

<p>3:27. Teth. It is good for a man, when he hath borne the yoke from his
youth.</p>

<p>3:28. Jod. He shall sit solitary, and hold his peace: because he hath
taken it up upon himself.</p>

<p>3:29. Jod. He shall put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be
hope.</p>

<p>3:30. Jod. He shall give his cheek to him that striketh him, he shall be
filled with reproaches.</p>

<p>3:31. Caph. For the Lord will not cast off for ever.</p>

<p>3:32. Caph. For if he hath cast off, he will also have mercy, according
to the multitude of his mercies.</p>

<p>3:33. Caph. For he hath not willingly afflicted, nor cast off the
children of men.</p>

<p>3:34. Lamed. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the land,</p>

<p>3:35. Lamed. To turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the
most High,</p>

<p>3:36. Lamed. To destroy a man wrongfully in his judgment, the Lord hath
not approved.</p>

<p>3:37. Mem. Who is he that hath commanded a thing to be done, when the
Lord commandeth it not?</p>

<p>3:38. Mem. Shall not both evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the
Highest?</p>

<p>3:39. Mem. Why hath a living man murmured, man suffering for his sins?</p>

<p>3:40. Nun. Let us search our ways, and seek, and return to the Lord.</p>

<p>3:41. Nun. Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the Lord in the
heavens.</p>

<p>3:42. Nun. We have done wickedly, and provoked thee to wrath: therefore
thou art inexorable.</p>

<p>3:43. Samech. Thou hast covered in thy wrath, and hast struck us: thou
hast killed and hast not spared.</p>

<p>3:44. Samech. Thou hast set a cloud before thee, that our prayer may not
pass through.</p>

<p>3:45. Samech. Thou hast made me as an outcast, and refuse in the midst
of the people.</p>

<p>3:46. Phe. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</p>

<p>3:47. Phe. Prophecy is become to us a fear, and a snare, and
destruction.</p>

<p>3:48. Phe. My eye hath run down with streams of water, for the
destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>

<p>3:49. Ain. My eye is afflicted, and hath not been quiet, because there
was no rest:</p>

<p>3:50. Ain. Till the Lord regarded and looked down from the heavens.</p>

<p>3:51. Ain. My eye hath wasted my soul because of all the daughters of my
city.</p>

<p>3:52. Sade. My enemies have chased me and caught me like a bird, without
cause.</p>

<p>3:53. Sade. My life is fallen into the pit, and they have laid a stone
over me.</p>

<p>3:54. Sade. Waters have flowed over my head: I said: I am cut off.</p>

<p>3:55. Coph. I have called upon thy name, O Lord, from the lowest pit.</p>

<p>3:56. Coph. Thou hast heard my voice: turn not away thy ear from my
sighs, and cries.</p>

<p>3:57. Coph. Thou drewest near in the day, when I called upon thee, thou
saidst: Fear not.</p>

<p>3:58. Res. Thou hast judged, O Lord, the cause of my soul, thou the
Redeemer of my life.</p>

<p>3:59. Res. Thou hast seen, O Lord, their iniquity against me: judge thou
my judgment.</p>

<p>3:60. Res. Thou hast seen all their fury, and all their thoughts against
me.</p>

<p>3:61. Sin. Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord, all their
imaginations against me.</p>

<p>3:62. Sin. The lips of them that rise up against me: and their devices
against me all the day.</p>

<p>3:63. Sin. Behold their sitting down, and their rising up, I am their
song.</p>

<p>3:64. Thau. Thou shalt render them a recompense, O Lord, according to
the works of their hands.</p>

<p>3:65. Thau. Thou shalt give them a buckler of heart, thy labour.</p>

<p>3:66. Thau. Thou shalt persecute them in anger, and shalt destroy them
from under the heavens, O Lord.</p>

<p>Lamentations Chapter 4</p>

<p>4:1. Aleph. How is the gold become dim, the finest colour is changed,
the stones of the sanctuary are scattered in the top of every street?</p>

<p>4:2. Beth. The noble sons of Sion, and they that were clothed with the
best gold: how are they esteemed as earthen vessels, the work of the
potter's hands?</p>

<p>4:3. Ghimel. Even the sea monsters have drawn out the breast, they have
given suck to their young: the daughter of my people is cruel, like the
ostrich in the desert.</p>

<p>4:4. Daleth. The tongue of the sucking child hath stuck to the roof of
his mouth for thirst: the little ones have asked for bread, and there
was none to break it unto them.</p>

<p>4:5. He. They that were fed delicately have died in the streets: they
that were brought up in scarlet have embraced the dung.</p>

<p>4:6. Vau. And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is made greater
than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and hands took
nothing in her.</p>

<p>4:7. Zain. Her Nazarites were whiter than snow, purer than milk, more
ruddy than the old ivory, fairer than the sapphire.</p>

<p>4:8. Heth. Their face is now made blacker than coals, and they are not
known in the streets: their skin hath stuck to their bones, it is
withered, and is become like wood.</p>

<p>4:9. Teth. It was better with them that were slain by the sword, than
with them that died with hunger: for these pined away being consumed for
want of the fruits of the earth.</p>

<p>4:10. Jod. The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own
children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my
people.</p>

<p>4:11. Caph. The Lord hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his
fierce anger: and he hath kindled a fire in Sion, and it hath devoured
the foundations thereof.</p>

<p>4:12. Lamed. The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the
world would not have believed, that the adversary and the enemy should
enter in by the gates of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>4:13. Mem. For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her
priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.</p>

<p>4:14. Nun. They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they were
defiled with blood: and when they could not help walking in it, they
held up their skirts.</p>

<p>4:15. Samech. Depart you that are defiled, they cried out to them:
Depart, get ye hence, touch not: for they quarrelled, and being removed,
they said among the Gentiles: He will no more dwell among them.</p>

<p>4:16. Phe. The face of the Lord hath divided them, he will no more
regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, neither had
they pity on the ancient.</p>

<p>4:17. Ain. While we were yet standing, our eyes failed, expecting help
for us in vain, when we looked attentively towards a nation that was not
able to save.</p>

<p>4:18. Sade. Our steps have slipped in the way of our streets, our end
draweth near: our days are fulfilled, for our end is come.</p>

<p>4:19. Coph. Our persecutors were swifter than the eagles of the air:
they pursued us upon the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the
wilderness.</p>

<p>4:20. Res. The breath of our mouth, Christ the Lord, is taken in our
sins: to whom we said: Under thy shadow we shall live among the
Gentiles.</p>

<p>Christ, etc... This, according to the letter, is spoken of their king,
who is called the Christ, that is, the Anointed of the Lord. But it also
relates, in the spiritual sense, to Christ our Lord, suffering for our
sins.</p>

<p>4:21. Sin. Rejoice, and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in
the land of Hus: to thee also shall the cup come, thou shalt be made
drunk, and naked.</p>

<p>4:22. Thau. Thy iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Sion, he will no
more carry thee away into captivity: he hath visited thy iniquity, O
daughter of Edom, he hath discovered thy sins.</p>

<p>THE PRAYER OF JEREMIAS THE PROPHET</p>

<p>Lamentations Chapter 5</p>

<p>5:1. Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us: consider and behold our
reproach.</p>

<p>5:2. Our inheritance is turned to aliens: our houses to strangers.</p>

<p>5:3. We are become orphans without a father: our mothers are as widows.</p>

<p>5:4. We have drunk our water for money: we have bought our wood.</p>

<p>5:6. We were dragged by the necks, we were weary and no rest was given
us.</p>

<p>5:6. We have given our hand to Egypt, and to the Assyrians, that we
might be satisfied with bread.</p>

<p>5:7. Our fathers have sinned, and are not: and we have borne their
iniquities.</p>

<p>5:8. Servants have ruled over us: there was none to redeem us out of
their hand.</p>

<p>5:9. We fetched our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the
sword in the desert.</p>

<p>5:10. Our skin was burnt as an oven, by reason of the violence of the
famine.</p>

<p>5:11. They oppressed the women in Sion, and the virgins in the cities of
Juda.</p>

<p>5:12. The princes were hanged up by their hand: they did not respect the
persons of the ancients.</p>

<p>5:13. They abused the young men indecently: and the children fell under
the wood.</p>

<p>5:14. The ancients have ceased from the gates: the young men from the
choir of the singers.</p>

<p>5:15. The joy of our heart is ceased, our dancing is turned into
mourning.</p>

<p>5:16. The crown is fallen from our head: woe to us, because we have
sinned.</p>

<p>5:17. Therefore is our heart sorrowful, therefore are our eyes become
dim.</p>

<p>5:18. For mount Sion, because it is destroyed, foxes have walked upon
it.</p>

<p>5:19. But thou, O Lord, shalt remain for ever, thy throne from
generation to generation.</p>

<p>5:20. Why wilt thou forget us for ever? why wilt thou forsake us for a
long time?</p>

<p>5:21. Convert us, O Lord, to thee, and we shall be converted: renew our
days, as from the beginning.</p>

<p>5:22. But thou hast utterly rejected us, thou art exceedingly angry with
us.</p>

<p>***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BIBLE, DOUAY-RHEIMS VERSION, BOOK 29: LAMENTATIONS OF JEREMIAS***
</p>
<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
