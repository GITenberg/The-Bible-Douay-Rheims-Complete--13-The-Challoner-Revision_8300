<p>THE BOOK OF PROVERBS</p>

<p>This Book is so called, because it consists of wise and weighty
sentences: regulating the morals of men: and directing them to wisdom
and virtue. And these sentences are also called PARABLES, because great
truths are often couched in them under certain figures and similitudes.</p>

<p>
Proverbs Chapter 1</p>

<p>The use and end of the proverbs. An exhortation to flee the company of
the wicked: and to hearken to the voice of wisdom.</p>

<p>1:1. The parables of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel,</p>

<p>1:2. To know wisdom, and instruction:</p>

<p>1:3. To understand the words of prudence: and to receive the instruction
of doctrine, justice, and judgment, and equity:</p>

<p>1:4. To give subtilty to little ones, to the young man knowledge and
understanding.</p>

<p>1:5. A wise man shall hear, and shall be wiser: and he that
understandeth shall possess governments.</p>

<p>1:6. He shall understand a parable and the interpretation, the words of
the wise, and their mysterious sayings.</p>

<p>1:7. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fools despise
wisdom and instruction.</p>

<p>1:8. My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law
of thy mother:</p>

<p>1:9. That grace may be added to thy head, and a chain of gold to thy
neck.</p>

<p>1:10. My son, if sinners shall entice thee, consent not to them.</p>

<p>1:11. If they shall say: Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let
us hide snares for the innocent without cause:</p>

<p>1:12. Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and whole as one that goeth
down into the pit.</p>

<p>1:13. We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses
with spoils.</p>

<p>1:14. Cast in thy lot with us, let us all have one purse.</p>

<p>1:15. My son, walk not thou with them, restrain thy foot from their
paths.</p>

<p>1:16. For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</p>

<p>1:17. But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have
wings.</p>

<p>1:18. And they themselves lie in wait for their own blood, and practise
deceits against their own souls.</p>

<p>1:19. So the ways of every covetous man destroy the souls of the
possessors.</p>

<p>1:20. Wisdom preacheth abroad, she uttereth her voice in the streets:</p>

<p>1:21. At the head of multitudes she crieth out, in the entrance of the
gates of the city she uttereth her words, saying:</p>

<p>1:22. O children, how long will you love childishness, and fools covet
those things which are hurtful to themselves, and the unwise hate
knowledge?</p>

<p>1:23. Turn ye at my reproof: behold I will utter my spirit to you, and
will shew you my words.</p>

<p>1:24. Because I called, and you refused: I stretched out my hand, and
there was none that regarded.</p>

<p>1:25. You have despised all my counsel, and have neglected my
reprehensions.</p>

<p>1:26. I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that
shall come to you which you feared.</p>

<p>1:27. When sudden calamity shall fall on you, and destruction, as a
tempest, shall be at hand: when tribulation and distress shall come upon
you:</p>

<p>1:28. Then shall they call upon me, and I will not hear: they shall rise
in the morning, and shall not find me:</p>

<p>1:29. Because they have hated instruction, and received not the fear of
the Lord,</p>

<p>1:30. Nor consented to my counsel, but despised all my reproof.</p>

<p>1:31. Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, and shall be
filled with their own devices.</p>

<p>1:32. The turning away of little ones shall kill them, and the
prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>

<p>1:33. But he that shall hear me, shall rest without terror, and shall
enjoy abundance, without fear of evils.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 2</p>

<p>The advantages of wisdom: and the evils from which it delivers.</p>

<p>2:1. My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and wilt hide my
commandments with thee,</p>

<p>2:2. That thy ear may hearken to wisdom: incline thy heart to know
prudence.</p>

<p>2:3. For if thou shalt call for wisdom, and incline thy heart to
prudence:</p>

<p>2:4. If thou shalt seek her as money, and shalt dig for her as for a
treasure:</p>

<p>2:5. Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and shalt find the
knowledge of God:</p>

<p>2:6. Because the Lord giveth wisdom: and out of his mouth cometh
prudence and knowledge.</p>

<p>2:7. He wilt keep the salvation of the righteous, and protect them that
walk in simplicity,</p>

<p>2:8. Keeping the paths of justice, and guarding the ways of saints.</p>

<p>2:9. Then shalt thou understand justice, and judgment, and equity, and
every good path.</p>

<p>2:10. If wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge please thy
soul:</p>

<p>2:11. Counsel shall keep thee, and prudence shall preserve thee,</p>

<p>2:12. That thou mayst be delivered from the evil way, and from the man
that speaketh perverse things:</p>

<p>2:13. Who leave the right way, and walk by dark ways:</p>

<p>2:14. Who are glad when they have done evil, and rejoice in the most
wicked things:</p>

<p>2:15. Whose ways are perverse, and their steps infamous.</p>

<p>2:16. That thou mayst be delivered from the strange woman, and from the
stranger, who softeneth her words;</p>

<p>2:17. And forsaketh the guide of her youth,</p>

<p>2:18. And hath forgotten the covenant of her God: for her house
inclineth unto death, and her paths to hell.</p>

<p>2:19. None that go in unto her, shall return again, neither shall they
take hold of the paths of life.</p>

<p>2:20. That thou mayst walk in a good way: and mayst keep the paths of
the just.</p>

<p>2:21. For they that are upright, shall dwell in the earth; and the
simple shall continue in it.</p>

<p>2:22. But the wicked shall be destroyed from the earth: and they that do
unjustly, shall be taken away from it.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 3</p>

<p>An exhortation to the practice of virtue.</p>

<p>3:1. My son, forget not my law, and let thy heart keep my commandments.</p>

<p>3:2. &nbsp;For they shall add to thee length of days, and years of life, and
peace.</p>

<p>3:3. Let not mercy and truth leave thee, put them about thy neck, and
write them in the tables of thy heart.</p>

<p>3:4. And thou shalt find grace, and good understanding before God and
men.</p>

<p>3:5. Have confidence in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not upon
thy own prudence.</p>

<p>3:6. In all thy ways think on him, and he will direct thy steps.</p>

<p>3:7. Be not wise in thy own conceit: fear God, and depart from evil:</p>

<p>3:8. For it shall be health to thy navel, and moistening to thy bones.</p>

<p>3:9. Honour the Lord with thy substance, and give him of the first of
all thy fruits;</p>

<p>3:10. And thy barns shall be filled with abundance, and thy presses
shall run over with wine.</p>

<p>3:11. My son, reject not the correction of the Lord: and do not faint
when thou art chastised by him:</p>

<p>3:12. For whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth: and as a father in the
son he pleaseth himself.</p>

<p>3:13. Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom, and is rich in prudence:</p>

<p>3:14. The purchasing thereof is better than the merchandise of silver,
and her fruit than the chief and purest gold:</p>

<p>3:15. She is more precious than all riches: and all the things that are
desired, are not to be compared to her.</p>

<p>3:16. Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches
and glory.</p>

<p>3:17. Her ways are beautiful ways, and all her paths are peaceable.</p>

<p>3:18. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her: and he that
shall retain her is blessed.</p>

<p>3:19. The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth, hath established the
heavens by prudence.</p>

<p>3:20. By his wisdom the depths have broken out, and the clouds grow
thick with dew.</p>

<p>3:21. My son, let not these things depart from thy eyes: keep the law
and counsel:</p>

<p>3:22. And there shall be life to thy soul, and grace to thy mouth.</p>

<p>3:23. Then shalt thou walk confidently in thy way, and thy foot shall
not stumble:</p>

<p>3:24. If thou sleep, thou shalt not fear: thou shalt rest, and thy sleep
shall be sweet.</p>

<p>3:25. Be not afraid of sudden fear, nor of the power of the wicked
falling upon thee.</p>

<p>3:26. For the Lord will be at thy side, and will keep thy foot that thou
be not taken.</p>

<p>3:27. Do not withhold him from doing good, who is able: if thou art
able, do good thyself also.</p>

<p>3:28. Say not to thy friend: Go, and come again: and to morrow I will
give to thee: when thou canst give at present.</p>

<p>3:29. Practise not evil against thy friend, when he hath confidence in
thee.</p>

<p>3:30. Strive not against a man without cause, when he hath done thee no
evil.</p>

<p>3:31. Envy not the unjust man, and do not follow his ways.</p>

<p>3:32. For every mocker is an abomination to the Lord, and his
communication is with the simple.</p>

<p>3:33. Want is from the Lord in the house of the wicked: but the
habitations of the just shall be blessed.</p>

<p>3:34. He shall scorn the scorners, and to the meek he will give grace.</p>

<p>3:35. The wise shall possess glory: the promotion of fools is disgrace.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 4</p>

<p>A further exhortation to seek after wisdom.</p>

<p>4:1. Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend, that
you may know prudence.</p>

<p>4:2. I will give you a good gift, forsake not my law.</p>

<p>4:3. For I also was my father's son, tender, and as an only son in the
sight of my mother:</p>

<p>4:4. And he taught me, and said: Let thy heart receive my words, keep my
commandments, and thou shalt live.</p>

<p>4:5. Get wisdom, get prudence: forget not, neither decline from the
words of my mouth.</p>

<p>4:6. Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee: love her, and she shall
preserve thee.</p>

<p>4:7. The beginning of wisdom, get wisdom, and with all thy possession
purchase prudence.</p>

<p>4:8. Take hold on her, and she shall exalt thee: thou shalt be glorified
by her, when thou shalt embrace her.</p>

<p>4:9. She shall give to thy head increase of graces, and protect thee
with a noble crown.</p>

<p>4:10. Hear, O my son, and receive my words, that years of life may be
multiplied to thee.</p>

<p>4:11. I will shew thee the way of wisdom, I will lead thee by the paths
of equity:</p>

<p>4:12. Which when thou shalt have entered, thy steps shall not be
straitened, and when thou runnest, thou shalt not meet a stumblingblock.</p>

<p>4:13. Take hold on instruction, leave it not: keep it, because it is thy
life.</p>

<p>4:14. Be not delighted in the paths of the wicked, neither let the way
of evil men please thee.</p>

<p>4:15. Flee from it, pass not by it: go aside, and forsake it.</p>

<p>4:16. For they sleep not, except they have done evil: and their sleep is
taken away unless they have made some to fall.</p>

<p>4:17. They eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of iniquity.</p>

<p>4:18. But the path of the just, as a shining light, goeth forwards, and
increaseth even to perfect day.</p>

<p>4:19. The way of the wicked is darksome: they know not where they fall.</p>

<p>4:20. My son, hearken to my words, and incline thy ear to my sayings.</p>

<p>4:21. Let them not depart from thy eyes, keep them in the midst of thy
heart:</p>

<p>4:22. For they are life to those that find them, and health to all
flesh.</p>

<p>4:23. With all watchfulness keep thy heart, because life issueth out
from it.</p>

<p>4:24. Remove from thee a froward mouth, and let detracting lips be far
from thee.</p>

<p>4:25. Let thy eyes look straight on, and let thy eyelids go before thy
steps.</p>

<p>4:26. Make straight the path for thy feet, and all thy ways shall be
established.</p>

<p>4:27. Decline not to the right hand, nor to the left: turn away thy foot
from evil. For the Lord knoweth the ways that are on the right hand: but
those are perverse which are on the left hand. But he will make thy
courses straight, he will bring forward thy ways in peace.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 5</p>

<p>An exhortation to fly unlawful lust, and the occasions of it.</p>

<p>5:1. My son, attend to my wisdom, and incline thy ear to my prudence,</p>

<p>5:2. That thou mayst keep thoughts, and thy lips may preserve
instruction. Mind not the deceit of a woman.</p>

<p>5:3. For the lips of a harlot are like a honeycomb dropping, and her
throat is smoother than oil.</p>

<p>5:4. But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>

<p>5:5. Her feet go down into death, and her steps go in as far as hell.</p>

<p>5:6. They walk not by the path of life, her steps are wandering, and
unaccountable.</p>

<p>5:7. Now, therefore, my son, hear me, and depart not from the words of
my mouth.</p>

<p>5:8. Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the doors of her
house.</p>

<p>5:9. Give not thy honour to strangers, and thy years to the cruel.</p>

<p>5:10. Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours be in
another man's house,</p>

<p>5:11. And thou mourn at the last, when thou shalt have spent thy flesh
and thy body, and say;</p>

<p>5:12. Why have I hated instruction, and my heart consented not to
reproof,</p>

<p>5:13. And have not heard the voice of them that taught me, and have not
inclined my ear to masters?</p>

<p>5:14. I have almost been in all evil, in the midst of the church and of
the congregation.</p>

<p>5:15. Drink water out of thy own cistern, and the streams of thy own
well:</p>

<p>5:16. Let thy fountains be conveyed abroad, and in the streets divide
thy waters.</p>

<p>5:17. Keep them to thyself alone, neither let strangers be partakers
with thee.</p>

<p>5:18. Let thy vein be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of thy youth:</p>

<p>5:19. Let her be thy dearest hind, and most agreeable fawn: let her
breasts inebriate thee at all times: be thou delighted continually with
her love.</p>

<p>5:20. Why art thou seduced, my son, by a strange woman, and art
cherished in the bosom of another?</p>

<p>5:21. The Lord beholdeth the ways of man, and considereth all his steps.</p>

<p>5:22. His own iniquities catch the wicked, and he is fast bound with the
ropes of his own sins.</p>

<p>5:23. He shall die, because he hath not received instruction, and in the
multitude of his folly he shall be deceived.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 6</p>

<p>Documents on several heads.</p>

<p>6:1. My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, thou hast engaged fast
thy hand to a stranger,</p>

<p>6:2. Thou art ensnared with the words of thy mouth, and caught with thy
own words.</p>

<p>6:3. Do, therefore, my son, what I say, and deliver thyself: because
thou art fallen into the hand of thy neighbour. &nbsp;Run about, make haste,
stir up thy friend:</p>

<p>6:4. Give not sleep to thy eyes, neither let thy eyelids slumber.</p>

<p>6:5. Deliver thyself as a doe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand
of the fowler.</p>

<p>6:6. Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom:</p>

<p>6:7. Which, although she hath no guide, nor master, nor captain,</p>

<p>6:8. Provideth her meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth her
food in the harvest.</p>

<p>6:9. How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? &nbsp;when wilt thou arise out of
thy sleep?</p>

<p>6:10. Thou wilt sleep a little, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt
fold thy hands a little to sleep:</p>

<p>6:11. And want shall come upon thee, as a traveller, and poverty as a
man armed. But if thou be diligent, thy harvest shall come as a
fountain, and want shall flee far from thee.</p>

<p>6:12. A man that is an apostate, an unprofitable man, walketh with a
perverse mouth,</p>

<p>6:13. He winketh with the eyes, presseth with the foot, speaketh with
the finger.</p>

<p>6:14. With a wicked heart he deviseth evil, and at all times he soweth
discord.</p>

<p>6:15. To such a one his destruction shall presently come, and he shall
suddenly be destroyed, and shall no longer have any remedy.</p>

<p>6:16. Six things there are, which the Lord hateth, and the seventh his
soul detesteth:</p>

<p>6:17. Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,</p>

<p>6:18. A heart that deviseth wicked plots, feet that are swift to run
into mischief,</p>

<p>6:19. A deceitful witness that uttereth lies, and him that soweth
discord among brethren.</p>

<p>6:20. My son, keep the commandments of thy father, and forsake not the
law of thy mother.</p>

<p>6:21. Bind them in thy heart continually, and put them about thy neck.</p>

<p>6:22. When thou walkest, let them go with thee: when thou sleepest, let
them keep thee, and when thou awakest, talk with them.</p>

<p>6:23. Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light, and
reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</p>

<p>6:24. That they may keep thee from the evil woman, and from the
flattering tongue of the stranger.</p>

<p>6:25. Let not thy heart covet her beauty, be not caught with her winks:</p>

<p>6:26. For the price of a harlot is scarce one loaf: but the woman
catcheth the precious soul of a man.</p>

<p>6:27. Can a man hide fire in his bosom, and his garments not burn?</p>

<p>6:28. Or can he walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burnt?</p>

<p>6:29. So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife, shall not be clean
when he shall touch her.</p>

<p>6:30. The fault is not so great when a man hath stolen: for he stealeth
to fill his hungry soul:</p>

<p>The fault is not so great, etc... The sin of theft is not so great, as
to be compared with adultery: especially when a person pressed with
hunger (which is the case here spoken of) steals to satisfy nature.
Moreover the damage done by theft may much more easily be repaired, than
the wrong done by adultery. But this does not hinder, but that theft
also is a mortal sin, forbidden by one of the ten commandments.</p>

<p>6:31. And if he be taken, he shall restore sevenfold, and shall give up
all the substance of his house.</p>

<p>6:32. But he that is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart shall
destroy his own soul:</p>

<p>6:33. He gathereth to himself shame and dishonour, and his reproach
shall not be blotted out:</p>

<p>6:34. Because the jealousy and rage of the husband will not spare in the
day of revenge,</p>

<p>6:35. Nor will he yield to any man's prayers, nor will he accept for
satisfaction ever so many gifts.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 7</p>

<p>The love of wisdom is the best preservative from being led astray by
temptation.</p>

<p>7:1. My son, keep my words, and lay up my precepts with thee. Son,</p>

<p>7:2. Keep my commandments, and thou shalt live: and my law as the apple
of thy eye:</p>

<p>7:3. Bind it upon thy fingers, write it upon the tables of thy heart.</p>

<p>7:4. Say to wisdom: Thou art my sister: and call prudence thy friend,</p>

<p>7:5. That she may keep thee from the woman that is not thine, and from
the stranger who sweeteneth her words.</p>

<p>7:6. For I looked out of the window of my house through the lattice,</p>

<p>7:7. And I see little ones, I behold a foolish young man,</p>

<p>7:8. Who passeth through the street by the corner, and goeth nigh the
way of her house,</p>

<p>7:9. In the dark when it grows late, in the darkness and obscurity of
the night.</p>

<p>7:10. And behold a woman meeteth him in harlot's attire, prepared to
deceive souls: talkative and wandering,</p>

<p>7:11. Not bearing to be quiet, not able to abide still at home,</p>

<p>7:12. Now abroad, now in the streets, now lying in wait near the
corners.</p>

<p>7:13. And catching the young man, she kisseth him, and with an impudent
face, flattereth, saying:</p>

<p>7:14. I vowed victims for prosperity, this day I have paid my vows.</p>

<p>7:15. Therefore I am come out to meet thee, desirous to see thee, and I
have found thee.</p>

<p>7:16. I have woven my bed with cords, I have covered it with painted
tapestry, brought from Egypt.</p>

<p>7:17. I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>

<p>7:18. Come, let us be inebriated with the breasts, and let us enjoy the
desired embraces, till the day appear.</p>

<p>7:19. For my husband is not at home, he is gone a very long journey.</p>

<p>7:20. He took with him a bag of money: he will return home the day of
the full moon.</p>

<p>7:21. She entangled him with many words, and drew him away with the
flattery of her lips.</p>

<p>7:22. Immediately he followeth her as an ox led to be a victim, and as a
lamb playing the wanton, and not knowing that he is drawn like a fool to
bonds,</p>

<p>7:23. Till the arrow pierce his liver: as if a bird should make haste to
the snare, and knoweth not that his life is in danger.</p>

<p>7:24. Now, therefore, my son, hear me, and attend to the words of my
mouth.</p>

<p>7:25. Let not thy mind be drawn away in her ways: neither be thou
deceived with her paths.</p>

<p>7:26. For she hath cast down many wounded, and the strongest have been
slain by her.</p>

<p>7:27. Her house is the way to hell, reaching even to the inner chambers
of death.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 8</p>

<p>The preaching of wisdom. Her excellence.</p>

<p>8:1. Doth not wisdom cry aloud, and prudence put forth her voice?</p>

<p>8:2. Standing in the top of the highest places by the way, in the midst
of the paths,</p>

<p>8:3. Beside the gates of the city, in the very doors she speaketh,
saying:</p>

<p>8:4. O ye men, to you I call, and my voice is to the sons of men.</p>

<p>8:5. O little ones understand subtlety, and ye unwise, take notice.</p>

<p>8:6. Hear, for I will speak of great things: and my lips shall be opened
to preach right things.</p>

<p>8:7. My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness.</p>

<p>8:8. All my words are just, there is nothing wicked, nor perverse in
them.</p>

<p>8:9. They are right to them that understand, and just to them that find
knowledge.</p>

<p>8:10. Receive my instruction, and not money: choose knowledge rather
than gold.</p>

<p>8:11. For wisdom is better than all the most precious things: and
whatsoever may be desired cannot be compared to it.</p>

<p>8:12. I, wisdom, dwell in counsel, and am present in learned thoughts.</p>

for me, shall find me.</p>

<p>8:18. With me are riches and glory, glorious riches and justice.</p>

<p>8:19. For my fruit is better than gold and the precious stone, and my
blossoms than choice silver.</p>

<p>8:20. I walk in the way of justice, in the midst of the paths of
judgment,</p>

<p>8:21. That I may enrich them that love me, and may fill their treasures.</p>

<p>8:22. The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made
any thing from the beginning.</p>

<p>8:23. I was set up from eternity, and of old, before the earth was made.</p>

<p>8:24. The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived, neither
had the fountains of waters as yet sprung out.</p>

<p>8:25. The mountains, with their huge bulk, had not as yet been
established: before the hills, I was brought forth:</p>

<p>8:26. He had not yet made the earth, nor the rivers, nor the poles of
the world.</p>

<p>8:27. When he prepared the heavens, I was present: when with a certain
law, and compass, he enclosed the depths:</p>

<p>8:28. When he established the sky above, and poised the fountains of
waters:</p>

<p>8:29. When he compassed the sea with its bounds, and set a law to the
waters that they should not pass their limits: when he balanced the
foundations of the earth;</p>

<p>8:30. I was with him forming all things: and was delighted every day,
playing before him at all times;</p>

<p>8:31. Playing in the world: and my delights were to be with the children
of men.</p>

<p>8:32. Now, therefore, ye children, hear me: blessed are they that keep
my ways.</p>

<p>8:33. Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>

<p>8:34. Blessed is the man that heareth me, and that watcheth daily at my
gates, and waiteth at the posts of my doors.</p>

<p>8:35. He that shall find me, shall find life, and shall have salvation
from the Lord.</p>

<p>8:36. But he that shall sin against me shall hurt his own soul. All that
hate me love death.</p>

<p>9:1. Wisdom hath built herself a house, she hath hewn her out seven
pillars.</p>

table.</p>

<p>9:3. She hath sent her maids to invite to the tower, and to the walls of
the city:</p>

<p>9:4. Whosoever is a little one, let him come to me. &nbsp;And to the unwise

you.</p>

will love thee.</p>

<p>9:9. Give an occasion to a wise man, and wisdom shall be added to him.
Teach a just man, and he shall make haste to receive it.</p>

<p>9:10. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge
of the holy is prudence.</p>

<p>9:11. For by me shall thy days be multiplied, and years of life shall be
added to thee.</p>

<p>9:12. If thou be wise, thou shalt be so to thyself: and if a scorner,
thou alone shalt bear the evil.</p>

<p>9:13. A foolish woman and clamorous, and full of allurements, and
knowing nothing at all,</p>

<p>9:14. Sat at the door of her house, upon a seat, in a high place of the
city,</p>

<p>9:15. To call them that pass by the way, and go on their journey:</p>

<p>9:16. He that is a little one, let him turn to me. And to the fool she
said:</p>

<p>9:17. Stolen waters are sweeter, and hidden bread is more pleasant.</p>

<p>9:18. And he did not know that giants are there, and that her guests are
in the depths of hell.</p>

<p>22:3. The prudent man saw the evil, and hid himself: the simple passed
on, and suffered loss.</p>

<p>22:4. The fruit of humility is the fear of the Lord, riches and glory
and life.</p>

<p>22:5. Arms and swords are in the way of the perverse: but he that
keepeth his own soul, departeth far from them.</p>

<p>22:6. It is a proverb: A young man according to his way, even when he is
old, he will not depart from it.</p>

<p>22:7. The rich ruleth over the poor: and the borrower is servant to him
that lendeth.</p>

<p>22:8. He that soweth iniquity, shall reap evils, and with the rod of his
anger he shall be consumed.</p>

<p>22:9. He that is inclined to mercy, shall be blessed: for of his bread
he hath given to the poor. &nbsp;He that maketh presents, shall purchase
victory and honour: but he carrieth away the souls of the receivers.</p>

<p>22:10. Cast out the scoffer, and contention shall go out with him, and
quarrels and reproaches shall cease.</p>

<p>22:11. He that loveth cleanness of heart, for the grace of his lips
shall have the king for his friend.</p>

unjust are overthrown.</p>

<p>22:13. The slothful man saith: There is a lion without, I shall be slain
in the midst of the streets.</p>

<p>22:14. The mouth of a strange woman is a deep pit: he whom the Lord is
angry with, shall fall into it.</p>

<p>22:15. Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, and the rod of
correction shall drive it away.</p>

<p>22:16. He that oppresseth the poor, to increase his own riches, shall
himself give to one that is richer, and shall be in need.</p>

<p>22:17. Incline thy ear, and hear the words of the wise: and apply thy
heart to my doctrine:</p>

<p>22:18. Which shall be beautiful for thee, if thou keep it in thy bowels,
and it shall flow in thy lips:</p>

<p>22:19. That thy trust may be in the Lord, wherefore I have also shewn it
to thee this day.</p>

<p>22:20. Behold I have described it to thee three manner of ways, in
thoughts and knowledge:</p>

<p>22:21. That I might shew thee the certainty, and the words of truth, to
answer out of these to them that sent thee.</p>

<p>22:22. Do no violence to the poor, because he is poor: and do not
oppress the needy in the gate:</p>

<p>22:23. Because the Lord will judge his cause: and will afflict them that
have afflicted his soul.</p>

<p>22:24. Be not a friend to an angry man, and do not walk with a furious
man:</p>

<p>22:25. Lest perhaps thou learn his ways, and take scandal to thy soul.</p>

<p>22:26. Be not with them that fasten down their hands, and that offer
themselves sureties for debts:</p>

<p>22:27. For if thou have not wherewith to restore, what cause is there
that he should take the covering from thy bed?</p>

<p>22:28. Pass not beyond the ancient bounds which thy fathers have set.</p>

<p>22:29. Hast thou seen a man swift in his work? he shall stand before
kings, and shall not be before those that are obscure.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 23</p>

<p>23:1. When thou shalt sit to eat with a prince, consider diligently what
is set before thy face:</p>

<p>23:2. And put a knife to thy throat, if it be so that thou have thy soul
in thy own power.</p>

<p>23:3. Be not desirous of his meats, in which is the bread of deceit.</p>

<p>23:4. Labour not to be rich: but set bounds to thy prudence.</p>

<p>23:5. Lift not up thy eyes to riches which thou canst not have: because
they shall make themselves wings like those of an eagle, and shall fly
towards heaven.</p>

<p>23:6. Eat not with an envious man, and desire not his meats:</p>

<p>23:7. Because, like a soothsayer, and diviner, he thinketh that which he
knoweth not. Eat and drink, will he say to thee: and his mind is not
with thee.</p>

<p>23:8. The meats which thou hadst eaten, thou shalt vomit up: and shalt
lose thy beantiful words.</p>

<p>23:9. Speak not in the ears of fools: because they will despise the
instruction of thy speech.</p>

<p>23:10. Touch not the bounds of little ones: and enter not into the field
of the fatherless:</p>

<p>23:11. For their near kinsman is strong: and he will judge their cause
against thee.</p>

of knowledge.</p>

<p>23:13. Withhold not correction from a child: for if thou strike him with
the rod, he shall not die.</p>

<p>23:15. My son, if thy mind be wise, my heart shall rejoice with thee:</p>

<p>23:16. And my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips shall speak what is
right.</p>

<p>23:17. Let not thy heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the
Lord all the day long:</p>

<p>23:18. Because thou shalt have hope in the latter end, and thy
expectation shall not be taken away.</p>

<p>23:19. Hear thou, my son, and be wise: and guide thy mind in the way.</p>

<p>23:20. Be not in the feasts of great drinkers, nor in their revellings,
who contribute flesh to eat:</p>

<p>23:21. Because they that give themselves to drinking, and that club
together, shall be consumed: and drowsiness shall be clothed with rags.</p>

<p>23:22. Hearken to thy father, that begot thee: and despise not thy
mother when she is old.</p>

<p>23:23. Buy truth, and do not sell wisdom, and instruction, and
understanding.</p>

<p>23:24. The father of the just rejoiceth greatly: he that hath begotten a
wise son, shall have joy in him.</p>

<p>23:25. Let thy father and thy mother be joyful, and let her rejoice that
bore thee.</p>

<p>23:26. My son, give me thy heart: and let thy eyes keep my ways.</p>

<p>23:27. For a harlot is a deep ditch: and a strange woman is a narrow
pit.</p>

<p>23:28. She lieth in wait in the way as a robber, and him whom she shall
see unwary, she will kill.</p>

<p>23:29. Who hath woe? whose father hath woe? who hath contentions? who
falls into pits? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of
eyes?</p>

<p>23:30. Surely they that pass their time in wine, and study to drink off
their cups.</p>

<p>23:31. Look not upon the wine when it is yellow, when the colour thereof
shineth in the glass: it goeth in pleasantly,</p>

<p>23:32. But in the end, it will bite like a snake, and will spread abroad
poison like a basilisk.</p>

<p>23:33. Thy eyes shall behold strange women, and thy heart shall utter
perverse things.</p>

<p>23:34. And thou shalt be as one sleeping in the midst of the sea, and as
a pilot fast asleep when the stern is lost.</p>

<p>23:35. And thou shalt say: They have beaten me, but I was not sensible
of pain: they drew me, and I felt not: when shall I awake and find wine
again?</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 24</p>

<p>24:1. Seek not to be like evil men, neither desire to be with them:</p>

<p>24:2. Because their mind studieth robberies, and their lips speak
deceits.</p>

<p>24:3. By wisdom the house shall be built, and by prudence it shall be
strengthened.</p>

<p>24:4. By instruction the storerooms shall be filled with all precious
and most beautiful wealth.</p>

<p>24:5. A wise man is strong: and a knowing man, stout and valiant.</p>

<p>24:6. Because war is managed by due ordering: and there shall be safety
where there are many counsels.</p>

<p>24:7. Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the gate he shall not open his
mouth.</p>

<p>24:8. He that deviseth to do evils, shall be called a fool.</p>

<p>24:9. The thought of a fool is sin: and the detractor is the abomination
of men.</p>

<p>24:10. If thou lose hope, being weary in the day of distress, thy
strength shall be diminished.</p>

<p>24:11. Deliver them that are led to death: and those that are drawn to
death, forbear not to deliver.</p>

<p>24:12. If thou say: I have not strength enough: he that seeth into the
heart, he understandeth, and nothing deceiveth the keeper of thy soul,
and he shall render to a man according to his works.</p>

<p>24:13. Eat honey, my son, because it is good, and the honeycomb most
sweet to thy throat.</p>

<p>24:14. So also is the doctrine of wisdom to thy soul: which when thou
hast found, thou shalt have hope in the end, and thy hope shall not
perish.</p>

<p>24:15. Lie not in wait, nor seek after wickedness in the house of the
just, nor spoil his rest.</p>

<p>24:16. For a just man shall fall seven times, and shall rise again: but
the wicked shall fall down into evil.</p>

<p>24:17. When thy enemy shall fall, be not glad, and in his ruin let not
thy heart rejoice:</p>

<p>24:18. Lest the Lord see, and it displease him, and he turn away his
wrath from him.</p>

<p>24:19. Contend not with the wicked, nor seek to be like the ungodly.</p>

<p>24:20. For evil men have no hope of things to come, and the lamp of the
wicked shall be put out.</p>

<p>24:21. My son, fear the Lord, and the king: and have nothing to do with
detractors.</p>

<p>24:22. For their destruction shall rise suddenly: and who knoweth the
ruin of both?</p>

<p>24:23. These things also to the wise: It is not good to have respect to
persons in judgment.</p>

<p>24:24. They that say to the wicked man: Thou art just: shall be cursed
by the people, and the tribes shall abhor them.</p>

<p>24:25. They that rebuke him shall be praised: and a blessing shall come
upon them.</p>

<p>24:26. He shall kiss the lips, who answereth right words.</p>

<p>24:27. Prepare thy work without, and diligently till thy ground: that
afterward thou mayst build thy house.</p>

<p>24:28. Be not witness without cause against thy neighbour: and deceive
not any man with thy lips.</p>

<p>24:29. Say not: I will do to him as he hath done to me: I will render to
every one according to his work.</p>

<p>24:30. I passed by the field of the slothful man, and by the vineyard of
the foolish man:</p>

<p>24:31. And behold it was all filled with nettles, and thorns had covered
the face thereof, and the stone wall was broken down.</p>

<p>24:32. Which when I had seen, I laid it up in my heart, and by the
example I received instruction.</p>

<p>24:33. Thou wilt sleep a little, said I, thou wilt slumber a little,
thou wilt fold thy hands a little to rest.</p>

<p>24:34. And poverty shall come to thee as a runner, and beggary as an
armed man.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 25</p>

<p>25:1. These are also parables of Solomon, which the men of Ezechias,
king of Juda, copied out.</p>

<p>25:2. It is the glory of God to conceal the word, and the glory of kings
to search out the speech.</p>

<p>25:3. The heaven above and the earth beneath, and the heart of kings is
unsearchable.</p>

<p>25:4. Take away the rust from silver, and there shall come forth a most
pure vessel:</p>

<p>25:5. Take away wickedness from the face of the king, and his throne
shall be established with justice.</p>

<p>25:6. Appear not glorious before the king, and stand not in the place of
great men.</p>

<p>25:7. For it is better that it should be said to thee: Come up hither;
than that thou shouldst be humbled before the prince.</p>

<p>25:8. The things which thy eyes have seen, utter not hastily in a
quarrel: lest afterward thou mayst not be able to make amends, when thou
hast dishonoured thy friend.</p>

<p>25:9. Treat thy cause with thy friend, and discover not the secret to a
stranger:</p>

<p>25:10. Lest he insult over thee, when he hath heard it, and cease not to
upbraid thee. &nbsp;Grace and friendship deliver a man: keep these for
thyself, lest thou fall under reproach.</p>

<p>25:11. To speak a word in due time, is like apples of gold on beds of
silver.</p>

<p>25:12. As an earring of gold and a bright pearl, so is he that reproveth
the wise, and the obedient ear.</p>

<p>25:13. As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
messenger to him that sent him, for he refresheth his soul.</p>

<p>25:14. As clouds, and wind, when no rain followeth, so is the man that
boasteth, and doth not fulfil his promises.</p>

<p>25:15. By patience a prince shall be appeased, and a soft tongue shall
break hardness.</p>

<p>25:16. Thou hast found honey, eat what is sufficient for thee, lest
being glutted therewith thou vomit it up.</p>

<p>25:17. Withdraw thy foot from the house of thy neighbour, lest having
his fill he hate thee.</p>

<p>25:18. A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour, is like a
dart and a sword and a sharp arrow.</p>

<p>25:19. To trust in an unfaithful man in the time of trouble, is like a
rotten tooth, and weary foot,</p>

<p>25:20. And one that looseth his garment in cold weather. As vinegar upon
nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a very evil heart. As a moth doth
by a garment, and a worm by the wood: so the sadness of a man consumeth
the heart.</p>

<p>25:21. If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat: if he thirst, give him
water to drink:</p>

<p>25:22. For thou shalt heap hot coals upon his head, and the Lord will
reward thee.</p>

<p>25:23. The north wind driveth away rain, as doth a sad countenance a
backbiting tongue.</p>

<p>25:24. It is better to sit in a corner of the housetop: than with a
brawling woman, and in a common house.</p>

<p>25:25. As cold water to a thirsty soul, so are good tidings from a far
country.</p>

<p>25:26. A just man falling down before the wicked, is as a fountain
troubled with the foot and a corrupted spring.</p>

<p>25:27. As it is not good for a man to eat much honey, so he that is a
searcher of majesty shall be overwhelmed by glory.</p>

<p>Majesty... Viz., of God. For to search into that incomprehensible
Majesty, and to pretend to sound the depths of the wisdom of God, is
exposing our weak understanding to be blinded with an excess of light
and glory, which it cannot comprehend.</p>

<p>25:28. As a city that lieth open and is not compassed with walls, so is
a man that cannot refrain his own spirit in speaking.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 26</p>

<p>26:1. As snow in summer, and rain in harvest, so glory is not seemly for
a fool.</p>

<p>26:2. As a bird flying to other places, and a sparrow going here or
there: so a curse uttered without cause shall come upon a man.</p>

<p>As a bird, etc... The meaning is, that a curse uttered without cause
shall do no harm to the person that is cursed, but will return upon him
that curseth, as whithersoever a bird flies, it returns to its own nest.</p>

<p>26:3. A whip for a horse, and a snaffle for an ass, and a rod for the
back of fools.</p>

<p>26:4. Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou be made like
him.</p>

<p>Answer not a fool, etc... Viz., so as to imitate him but only so as to
reprove his folly.</p>

<p>26:5. Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he imagine himself to
be wise.</p>

<p>26:6. He that sendeth words by a foolish messenger, is lame of feet and
drinketh iniquity.</p>

<p>26:7. As a lame man hath fair legs in vain: so a parable is unseemly in
the mouth of fools.</p>

<p>26:8. As he that casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury: so is he that
giveth honour to a fool.</p>

<p>26:9. As if a thorn should grow in the hand of a drunkard: so is a
parable in the mouth of fools.</p>

<p>26:10. Judgment determineth causes: and he that putteth a fool to
silence, appeaseth anger.</p>

<p>26:11. As a dog that returneth to his vomit, so is the fool that
repeateth his folly.</p>

<p>26:12. Hast thou seen a man wise in his own conceit? &nbsp;there shall be
more hope of a fool than of him.</p>

<p>26:13. The slothful man saith: There is a lion in the way, and a lioness
in the roads.</p>

<p>26:14. As the door turneth upon its hinges, so doth the slothful upon
his bed.</p>

<p>26:15. The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit, and it grieveth
him to turn it to his mouth.</p>

<p>26:16. The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit, than seven men that
speak sentences.</p>

<p>26:17. As he that taketh a dog by the ears, so is he that passeth by in
anger, and meddleth with another man's quarrel.</p>

<p>26:18. As he is guilty that shooteth arrows, and lances unto death.</p>

<p>26:19. So is the man that hurteth his friend deceitfully: and when he is
taken, saith: I did it in jest.</p>

<p>26:20. When the wood faileth, the fire shall go out: and when the
talebearer is taken away, contentions shall cease.</p>

<p>26:21. As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire, so an angry man
stirreth up strife.</p>

<p>26:22. The words of a talebearer are as it were simple, but they reach
to the innermost parts of the belly.</p>

<p>26:23. Swelling lips joined with a corrupt heart, are like an earthern
vessel adorned with silver dross.</p>

<p>26:24. An enemy is known by his lips, when in his heart he entertaineth
deceit.</p>

<p>26:25. When he shall speak low, trust him not: because there are seven
mischiefs in his heart.</p>

<p>26:26. He that covereth hatred deceitfully, his malice shall be laid
open in the public assembly.</p>

<p>26:27. He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that rolleth a
stone, it shall return to him.</p>

<p>26:28. A deceitful tongue loveth not truth: and a slippery mouth worketh
ruin.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 27</p>

<p>27:1. Boast not for to morrow, for thou knowest not what the day to come
may bring forth.</p>

<p>27:2. Let another praise thee, and not thy own mouth: a stranger, and
not thy own lips.</p>

<p>27:3. A stone is heavy, and sand weighty: but the anger of a fool is
heavier than them both.</p>

<p>27:4. Anger hath no mercy: nor fury, when it breaketh forth: and who can
bear the violence of one provoked?</p>

<p>27:5. Open rebuke is better than hidden love.</p>

<p>27:6. Better are the wounds of a friend, than the deceitful kisses of an
enemy.</p>

<p>27:7. A soul that is full shall tread upon the honeycomb: and a soul
that is hungry shall take even bitter for sweet.</p>

<p>27:8. As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that leaveth
his place.</p>

<p>27:9. Ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart: and the good counsels of
a friend are sweet to the soul.</p>

<p>27:10. Thy own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not: and go not
into thy brother's house in the day of thy affliction. &nbsp;Better is a
neighbour that is near than a brother afar off.</p>

<p>27:11. Study wisdom, my son, and make my heart joyful, that thou mayst
give an answer to him that reproacheth.</p>

<p>27:12. The prudent man seeing evil hideth himself: little ones passing
on have suffered losses.</p>

<p>27:13. Take away his garment that hath been surety for a stranger: and
take from him a pledge for strangers.</p>

<p>27:14. He that blesseth his neighbour with a loud voice, rising in the
night, shall be like to him that curseth.</p>

<p>27:15. Roofs dropping through in a cold day, and a contentious woman are
alike.</p>

<p>27:16. He that retaineth her, is as he that would hold the wind, and
shall call the oil of his right hand.</p>

<p>27:17. Iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his
friend.</p>

<p>27:18. He that keepeth the fig tree, shall eat the fruit thereof: and he
that is the keeper of his master, shall be glorified.</p>

<p>27:19. As the faces of them that look therein, shine in the water, so
the hearts of men are laid open to the wise.</p>

<p>27:20. Hell and destruction are never filled: so the eyes of men are
never satisfied.</p>

<p>27:21. As silver is tried in the fining-pot, and gold in the furnace: so
a man is tried by the mouth of him that praiseth. &nbsp;The heart of the
wicked seeketh after evils, but the righteous heart seeketh after
knowledge.</p>

<p>27:22. Though thou shouldst bray a fool in the mortar, as when a pestle
striketh upon sodden barley, his folly would not be taken from him.</p>

<p>27:23. Be diligent to know the countenance of thy cattle, and consider
thy own flocks:</p>

<p>27:24. For thou shalt not always have power: but a crown shall be given
to generation and generation.</p>

<p>27:25. The meadows are open, and the green herbs have appeared, and the
hay is gathered out of the mountains.</p>

<p>27:26. Lambs are for thy clothing: and kids for the price of the field.</p>

<p>27:27. Let the milk of the goats be enough for thy food, and for the
necessities of thy house, and for maintenance for thy handmaids.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 28</p>

<p>28:1. The wicked man fleeth, when no man pursueth: but the just, bold as
a lion, shall be without dread.</p>

<p>28:2. For the sins of the land many are the princes thereof: and for the
wisdom of a man, and the knowledge of those things that are said, the
life of the prince shall be prolonged.</p>

<p>28:3. A poor man that oppresseth the poor, is like a violent shower,
which bringeth a famine.</p>

<p>28:4. They that forsake the law, praise the wicked man: they that keep
it, are incensed against him.</p>

<p>28:5. Evil men think not on judgment: but they that seek after the Lord,
take notice of all things.</p>

<p>28:6. Better is the poor man walking in his simplicity, than the rich in
crooked ways.</p>

<p>28:7. He that keepeth the law, is a wise son: but he that feedeth
gluttons, shameth his father.</p>

<p>28:8. He that heapeth together riches by usury and loan, gathereth them
for him that will be bountiful to the poor.</p>

<p>28:9. He that turneth away his ears from hearing the law, his prayer
shall be an abomination.</p>

<p>28:10. He that deceiveth the just in a wicked way, shall fall in his own
destruction: and the upright shall possess his goods.</p>

<p>28:11. The rich man seemeth to himself wise: but the poor man that is
prudent shall search him out.</p>

<p>28:12. In the joy of the just there is great glory: when the wicked
reign, men are ruined.</p>

confess, and forsake them, shall obtain mercy.</p>

<p>28:14. Blessed is the man that is always fearful: but he that is
hardened in mind shall fall into evil.</p>

<p>28:15. As a roaring lion, and a hungry bear, so is a wicked prince over
the poor people.</p>

<p>28:16. A prince void of prudence shall oppress many by calumny: but he
that hateth covetousness, shall prolong his days.</p>

<p>28:17. A man that doth violence to the blood of a person, if he flee
even to the pit, no man will stay him.</p>

<p>28:18. He that walketh uprightly, shall be saved: he that is perverse in
his ways, shall fall at once.</p>

<p>28:19. He that tilleth his ground, shall be filled with bread: but he
that followeth idleness, shall be filled with poverty.</p>

<p>28:20. A faithful man shall be much praised: but he that maketh haste to
be rich, shall not be innocent.</p>

<p>28:21. He that hath respect to a person in judgment, doth not well: such
a man even for a morsel of bread forsaketh the truth.</p>

<p>28:22. A man that maketh haste to be rich, and envieth others, is
ignorant that poverty shall come upon him.</p>

<p>28:23. He that rebuketh a man, shall afterward find favour with him,
more than he that by a flattering tongue deceiveth him.</p>

<p>28:24. He that stealeth any thing from his father, or from his mother:
and saith, This is no sin, is the partner of a murderer.</p>

<p>28:26. He that boasteth and puffeth up himself, stirreth up quarrels:
but he that trusteth in the Lord, shall be healed.</p>

<p>28:26. He that trusteth in his own heart, is a fool: but he that walketh
wisely, he shall be saved.</p>

<p>28:27. He that giveth to the poor shall not want: he that despiseth his
intreaty, shall suffer indigence.</p>

<p>28:28. When the wicked rise up, men shall hide themselves: when they
perish, the just shall be multiplied.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 29</p>

<p>29:1. The man that with a stiff neck despiseth him that reproveth him,
shall suddenly be destroyed: and health shall not follow him.</p>

<p>29:2. When just men increase, the people shall rejoice: when the wicked
shall bear rule, the people shall mourn.</p>

<p>29:3. A man that loveth wisdom, rejoiceth his father: but he that
maintaineth harlots, shall squander away his substance.</p>

<p>29:4. A just king setteth up the land: a covetous man shall destroy it.</p>

<p>29:5. A man that speaketh to his friend with flattering and dissembling
words, spreadeth a net for his feet.</p>

<p>29:6. A snare shall entangle the wicked man when he sinneth: and the
just shall praise and rejoice.</p>

<p>29:7. The just taketh notice of the cause of the poor: the wicked is
void of knowledge.</p>

<p>29:8. Corrupt men bring a city to ruin: but wise men turn away wrath.</p>

<p>29:9. If a wise man contend with a fool, whether he be angry, or laugh,
he shall find no rest.</p>

<p>29:10. Bloodthirsty men hate the upright: but just men seek his soul.</p>

<p>29:11. A fool uttereth all his mind: a wise man deferreth, and keepeth
it till afterwards.</p>

<p>29:12. A prince that gladly heareth lying words, hath all his servants
wicked.</p>

<p>29:13. The poor man and the creditor have met one another: the Lord is
the enlightener of them both.</p>

<p>29:14. The king that judgeth the poor in truth, his throne shall be
established for ever.</p>

<p>29:15. The rod and reproof give wisdom: but the child that is left to
his own will, bringeth his mother to shame.</p>

<p>29:16. When the wicked are multiplied, crimes shall be multiplied: but
the just shall see their downfall.</p>

<p>29:17. Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee, and shall give
delight to thy soul.</p>

<p>29:18. When prophecy shall fail, the people shall be scattered abroad:
but he that keepeth the law, is blessed.</p>

<p>29:19. A slave will not be corrected by words: because he understandeth
what thou sayest, and will not answer.</p>

<p>29:20. Hast thou seen a man hasty to speak? folly is rather to be looked
for, than his amendment.</p>

<p>29:21. He that nourisheth his servant delicately from his childhood,
afterwards shall find him stubborn.</p>

<p>29:22. A passionate man provoketh quarrels: and he that is easily
stirred up to wrath, shall be more prone to sin.</p>

<p>29:23. Humiliation followeth the proud: and glory shall uphold the
humble of spirit.</p>

<p>29:24. He that is partaker with a thief, hateth his own soul: he heareth
one putting him to his oath, and discovereth not.</p>

<p>29:25. He that feareth man shall quickly fall: he that trusteth in the
Lord, shall be set on high.</p>

<p>29:26. Many seek the face of the prince: but the judgment of every one
cometh forth from the Lord.</p>

<p>29:27. The just abhor a wicked man: and the wicked loathe them that are
in the right way. &nbsp;The son that keepeth the word, shall be free from
destruction.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 30</p>

<p>The wise man thinketh humbly of himself. His prayer and sentiments upon
certain virtues and vices.</p>

<p>30:1. The words of Gatherer the son of Vomiter. The vision which the man
spoke, with whom God is, and who being strengthened by God, abiding with
him, said:</p>

<p>Gatherer, etc... Or, as it is in the Latin, Congregans the son of
Vomens. The Latin interpreter has given us in this place the
signification of the Hebrew names, instead of the names themselves,
which are in the Hebrew, Agur the son of Jakeh. But whether this Agur be
the same person as Solomon, as many think, or a different person, whose
doctrine was adopted by Solomon, and inserted among his parables or
proverbs, is uncertain.</p>

<p>30:2. I am the most foolish of men, and the wisdom of men is not with
me.</p>

<p>30:3. I have not learned wisdom, and have not known the science of
saints.</p>

<p>30:4. Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended? &nbsp;who hath held
the wind in his hands? who hath bound up the waters together as in a
garment? who hath raised up all the borders of the earth? what is his
name, and what is the name of his son, if thou knowest?</p>

<p>30:5. Every word of God is fire tried: he is a buckler to them that hope
in him.</p>

<p>Is fire tried... That is, most pure, like gold purified by fire.</p>

<p>30:6. Add not any thing to his words, lest thou be reproved and found a
liar:</p>

<p>30:7. Two things I have asked of thee, deny them not to me before I die.</p>

<p>30:8. Remove far from me vanity, and lying words. &nbsp;Give me neither
beggary, nor riches: give me only the necessaries of life:</p>

<p>30:9. Lest perhaps being filled, I should be tempted to deny, and say:
Who is the Lord? or being compelled by poverty, I should steal, and
forswear the name of my God.</p>

<p>30:10. Accuse not a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou
fall.</p>

<p>30:11. There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not
bless their mother.</p>

<p>30:12. A generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not
washed from their filthiness.</p>

<p>30:13. A generation, whose eyes are lofty, and their eyelids lifted up
on high.</p>

<p>30:14. A generation that for teeth hath swords, and grindeth with their
jaw teeth, to devour the needy from off the earth, and the poor from
among men.</p>

<p>30:15. The horseleech hath two daughters that say: Bring, bring. &nbsp;There
are three things that never are satisfied, and the fourth never saith:
It is enough.</p>

<p>The horseleech... Concupiscence, which hath two daughters that are never
satisfied, viz., lust and avarice.</p>

<p>30:16. Hell and the mouth of the womb, and the earth which is not
satisfied with water: and the fire never saith: It is enough.</p>

<p>30:17. The eye that mocketh at his father, and that despiseth the labour
of his mother in bearing him, let the ravens of the brooks pick it out,
and the young eagles eat it.</p>

<p>30:18. Three things are hard to me, and the fourth I am utterly ignorant
of.</p>

<p>30:19. The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon a rock,
the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man in
youth.</p>

<p>30:20. Such also is the way of an adulterous woman, who eateth and
wipeth her mouth, and saith: I have done no evil.</p>

<p>30:21. By three things the earth is disturbed, and the fourth it cannot
bear.</p>

<p>30:22. By a slave when he reigneth: by a fool when he is filled with
meat:</p>

<p>30:23. By an odious woman when she is married: and by a bondwoman when
she is heir to her mistress.</p>

<p>30:24. There are four very little things of the earth, and they are
wiser than the wise.</p>

<p>30:25. The ants, a feeble people, which provide themselves food in the
harvest:</p>

<p>30:26. The rabbit, a weak people, which maketh its bed in the rock:</p>

<p>30:27. The locust hath no king, yet they all go out by their bands:</p>

<p>30:28. The stellio supporteth itself on hands, and dwelleth in kings'
houses.</p>

<p>The stellio... A kind of house lizard marked with spots like stars, from
whence it has its name.</p>

<p>30:19. There are three things, which go well, and the fourth that
walketh happily:</p>

<p>30:30. A lion, the strongest of beasts, who hath no fear of any thing he
meeteth:</p>

<p>30:31. A cock girded about the loins: and a ram: and a king, whom none
can resist.</p>

<p>30:32. There is that hath appeared a fool after he was lifted up on
high: for if he had understood, he would have laid his hand upon his
mouth.</p>

<p>30:33. And he that strongly squeezeth the paps to bring out milk,
straineth out butter: and he that violently bloweth his nose, bringeth
out blood: and he that provoketh wrath, bringeth forth strife.</p>

<p>Proverbs Chapter 31</p>

<p>An exhortation to chastity, temperance, and works of mercy; with the
praise of a wise woman.</p>

<p>31:1. The words of king Lamuel. The vision wherewith his mother
instructed him.</p>

<p>Lamuel... This name signifies God with him, and is supposed to have been
one of the names of Solomon.</p>

<p>31:2. What, O my beloved, what, O the beloved of my womb, what, O the
beloved of my vows?</p>

<p>31:3. Give not thy substance to women, and thy riches to destroy kings.</p>

<p>31:4. Give not to kings, O Lamuel, give not wine to kings: because there
is no secret where drunkenness reigneth:</p>

<p>31:5. And lest they drink and forget judgments, and pervert the cause of
the children of the poor.</p>

<p>31:6. Give strong drink to them that are sad; and wine to them that are
grieved in mind:</p>

<p>31:7. Let them drink, and forget their want, and remember their sorrow
no more.</p>

<p>31:8. Open thy mouth for the dumb, and for the causes of all the
children that pass.</p>

<p>31:9. Open thy mouth, decree that which is just, and do justice to the
needy and poor.</p>

<p>31:10. Who shall find a valiant woman? far, and from the uttermost
coasts is the price of her.</p>

<p>31:11. The heart of her husband trusteth in her, and he shall have no
need of spoils.</p>

<p>31:12. She will render him good, and not evil all the days of her life.</p>

<p>31:13. She hath sought wool and flax, and hath wrought by the counsel of
her hands.</p>

<p>31:14. She is like the merchant's ship, she bringeth her bread from
afar.</p>

<p>31:15. And she hath risen in the night, and given a prey to her
household, and victuals to her maidens.</p>

<p>31:16. She hath considered a field, and bought it: with the fruit of her
hands she hath planted a vineyard.</p>

<p>31:17. She hath girded her loins with strength, and hath strengthened
her arm.</p>

<p>31:18. She hath tasted, and seen that her traffic is good: her lamp
shall not be put out in the night.</p>

<p>31:19. She hath put out her hand to strong things, and her fingers have
taken hold of the spindle.</p>

<p>31:20. She hath opened her hand to the needy, and stretched out her
hands to the poor.</p>

<p>31:21. She shall not fear for her house in the cold of snow: for all her
domestics are clothed with double garments.</p>

<p>31:22. She hath made for herself clothing of tapestry: fine linen, and
purple, is her covering.</p>

<p>31:23. Her husband is honourable in the gates, when he sitteth among the
senators of the land.</p>

<p>31:24. She made fine linen, and sold it, and delivered a girdle to the
Chanaanite.</p>

<p>The Chanaanite... The merchant, for Chanaanite, in Hebrew, signifies a
merchant.</p>

<p>31:25. Strength and beauty are her clothing, and she shall laugh in the
latter day.</p>

<p>31:26. She hath opened her mouth to wisdom, and the law of clemency is
on her tongue.</p>

<p>31:27. She hath looked well on the paths of her house, and hath not
eaten her bread idle.</p>

<p>31:28. Her children rose up, and called her blessed: her husband, and he
praised her.</p>

<p>31:29. Many daughters have gathered together riches: thou hast surpassed
them all.</p>

<p>31:30. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: the woman that feareth
the Lord, she shall be praised.</p>

<p>31:31. Give her of the fruit of her hands: and let her works praise her
in the gates.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
