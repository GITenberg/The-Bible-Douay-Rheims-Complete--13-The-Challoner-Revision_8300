<p>THE PROPHECY OF MICHEAS</p>

<p>MICHEAS, of Morasti, a little town in the tribe of JUDA, was
contemporary with the prophet ISAIAS: whom he resembles both in his
spirit and his style. He is different from the prophet MICHEAS mentioned
in the third book of Kings, chap. 22. For that MICHEAS lived in the days
of king ACHAB, one hundred and fifty years before the time of EZECHIAS,
under whom this MICHEAS prophesied.</p>

<p>
Micheas Chapter 1</p>

<p>Samaria for her sins shall be destroyed by the Assyrians; they shall
also invade Juda and Jerusalem.</p>

<p>1:1. The word of the Lord, that came to Micheas, the Morasthite, in the
days of Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda: which he saw
concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</p>

<p>1:2. Hear, all ye people: and let the earth give ear, and all that is
therein: and let the Lord God be a witness to you, the Lord from his
holy temple.</p>

<p>1:3. For behold the Lord will come forth out of his place: and he will
come down, and will tread upon the high places of the earth.</p>

<p>1:4. And the mountains shall be melted under him: and the valleys shall
be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as waters that run down a steep
place.</p>

<p>1:5. For the wickedness of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the
house of Israel. What is the wickedness of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and
what are the high places of Juda? are they not Jerusalem?</p>

<p>1:6. And I will make Samaria as a heap of stones in the field when a
vineyard is planted: and I will bring down the stones thereof into the
valley, and will lay her foundations bare.</p>

<p>1:7. And all her graven things shall be cut in pieces, and all her wages
shall be burnt with fire, and I will bring to destruction all her idols:
for they were gathered together of the hire of a harlot, and unto the
hire of a harlot they shall return.</p>

<p>Her wages... That is, her donaries or presents offered to her idols: or
the hire of all her traffic and labour. Ibid. Of the hire of a harlot,
etc... They were gathered together by one idolatrous city, viz.,
Samaria: and they shall be carried away to another idolatrous city,
viz., Ninive.</p>

<p>1:8. Therefore will I lament, and howl: I will go stript and naked: I
will make a wailing like the dragons, and a mourning like the ostriches.</p>

<p>1:9. Because her wound is desperate, because it is come even to Juda, it
hath touched the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>It hath touched the gate, etc... That is, the destruction of Samaria
shall be followed by the invasion of my people of Juda, and the
Assyrians shall come and lay all waste even to the confines of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>1:10. Declare ye it not in Geth, weep ye not with tears: in the house of
Dust sprinkle yourselves with dust.</p>

<p>Declare ye it not in Geth... Viz., amongst the Philistines, lest they
rejoice at your calamity.-Ibid. Weep ye not, etc... Keep in your tears,
that you may not give your enemies an occasion of insulting over you;
but in your own houses, or in your house of dust, your earthly
habitation, sprinkle yourselves with dust, and put on the habit of
penitents. Some take the house of dust (in Hebrew, Aphrah) to be the
proper name of a city.</p>

<p>1:11. And pass away, O thou that dwellest in the beautiful place,
covered with thy shame: she went not forth that dwelleth in the
confines: the house adjoining shall receive mourning from you, which
stood by herself.</p>

<p>Thou that dwellest in the Beautiful place, viz., in Samaria. In the
Hebrew the Beautiful place is expressed by the word Sapir, which some
take for the proper name of a city.--Ibid. She went not forth, etc...
that is, they that dwelt in the confines came not forth, but kept
themselves within, for fear.--Ibid. The house adjoining,etc... Viz.,
Judea and Jerusalem, neighbours to Samaria, and partners in her sins,
shall share also in her mourning and calamity; though they have
pretended to stand by themselves, trusting in their strength.</p>

<p>1:12. For she is become weak unto good that dwelleth in bitterness: for
evil is come down from the Lord into the gate of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>She is become weak, etc... Jerusalem is become weak unto any good;
because she dwells in the bitterness of sin.</p>

<p>1:13. A tumult of chariots hath astonished the inhabitants of Lachis: it
is the beginning of sin to the daughter of Sion for in thee were found
the crimes of Israel.</p>

<p>It is the beginning, etc... That is, Lachis was the first city of Juda
that learned from Samaria the worship of idols, and communicated it to
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>1:14. Therefore shall she send messengers to the inheritance of Geth:
the houses of lying to deceive the kings of Israel.</p>

<p>Therefore shall she send, etc... Lachis shall send to Geth for help: but
in vain: for Geth, instead of helping, shall be found to be a house of
lying and deceit to Israel.</p>

<p>1:15. Yet will I bring an heir to thee that dwellest in Maresa: even to
Odollam shall the glory of Israel come.</p>

<p>An heir, etc... Maresa (which was the name of a city of Juda) signifies
inheritance: but here God by his prophet tells the Jews, that he will
bring them an heir to take possession of their inheritance: and that the
glory of Israel shall be obliged to give place, and to retire even to
Odollam, a city in the extremity of their dominions. And therefore he
exhorts them to penance in the following verse.</p>

<p>1:16. Make thee bald, and be polled for thy delicate children: enlarge
thy baldness as the eagle: for they are carried into captivity from
thee.</p>

<p>Micheas Chapter 2</p>

<p>The Israelites by their crying injustices provoke God to punish them. He
shall at last restore Jacob.</p>

<p>2:1. Woe to you that devise that which is unprofitable, and work evil in
your beds: in the morning light they execute it, because their hand is
against God.</p>

<p>2:2. And they have coveted fields, and taken them by violence, and
houses they have forcibly taken away: and oppressed a man and his house,
a man and his inheritance.</p>

<p>2:3. Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I devise an evil against this
family: from which you shall not withdraw your necks, and you shall not
walk haughtily, for this is a very evil time.</p>

<p>2:4. In that day a parable shall be taken up upon you, and a song shall
be sung with melody by them that say: We are laid waste and spoiled: the
portion of my people is changed: how shall he depart from me, whereas he
is returning that will divide our land?</p>

<p>How shall he depart, etc... How do you pretend to say that the Assyrian
is departing; when indeed he is coming to divide our lands amongst his
subjects?</p>

<p>2:5. Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the cord of a lot in
the assembly of the Lord.</p>

<p>Thou shalt have none, etc... Thou shalt have no longer any lot or
inheritance in the land of the people of the Lord.</p>

<p>2:6. Speak ye not, saying: It shall not drop upon these, confusion shall
not take them.</p>

<p>It shall not drop, etc... That is, the prophecy shall not come upon
these. Such were the sentiments of the people that were unwilling to
believe the threats of the prophets.</p>

<p>2:7. The house of Jacob saith: Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened or
are these his thoughts? Are not my words good to him that walketh
uprightly?</p>

<p>2:8. But my people, on the contrary, are risen up as an enemy: you have
taken away the cloak off from the coat: and them that passed harmless
you have turned to war.</p>

<p>You have taken away, etc... You have even stripped people of their
necessary garments: and have treated such as were innocently passing on
the way, as if they were at war with you.</p>

<p>2:9. You have cast out the women of my people from their houses, in
which they took delight: you have taken my praise forever from their
children.</p>

<p>You have cast out, etc... either by depriving them of their houses: or,
by your crimes, given occasion to their being carried away captives, and
their children, by that means, never learning to praise the Lord.</p>

<p>2:10. Arise ye, and depart, for there is no rest here for you. For that
uncleanness of the land, it shall be corrupted with a grievous
corruption.</p>

<p>2:11. Would God I were not a man that hath the spirit, and that I rather
spoke a lie: I will let drop to thee of wine, and of drunkeness: and it
shall be this people upon whom it shall drop.</p>

<p>Would God, etc... The prophet could have wished, out of his love to his
people, that he might be deceived in denouncing to them these evils that
were to fall upon them: but by conforming himself to the will of God, he
declares to them, that he is sent to prophesy, literally to let drop
upon them, the wine of God's indignation, with which they should be made
drunk; that is, stupified and cast down.</p>

<p>2:12. I will assemble and gather together all of thee, O Jacob: I will
bring together the remnant of Israel, I will put them together as a
flock in the fold, as sheep in the midst of the sheepcotes, they shall
make a tumult by reason of the multitude of men.</p>

<p>2:13. For he shall go up that shall open the way before them: they shall
divide and pass through the gate, and shall come in by it: and their
king shall pass before them, and the Lord at the head of them.</p>

<p>Micheas Chapter 3</p>

<p>For the sins of the rich oppressing the poor, of false prophets
flattering for lucre, and of judges perverting justice, Jerusalem and
the temple shall be destroyed.</p>

<p>3:1. And I said: Hear, O ye princes of Jacob, and ye chiefs of the house
of Israel: Is it not your part to know judgment,</p>

<p>3:2. You that hate good, and love evil: that violently pluck off their
skins from them and their flesh from their bones?</p>

<p>3:3. Who have eaten the flesh of my people, and have flayed their skin
off them: and have broken, and chopped their bones as for the kettle,
and as flesh in the midst of the pot.</p>

<p>3:4. Then shall they cry to the Lord, and he will not hear them: and he
will hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved wickedly
in their devices.</p>

<p>3:5. Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people
err: that bite with their teeth, and preach peace: and if a man give not
something into their mouth, they prepare war against him.</p>

<p>3:6. Therefore night shall be to you instead of vision, and darkness to
you instead of divination: and the sun shall go down upon the prophets,
and the day shall be darkened over them.</p>

<p>3:7. And they shall be confounded that see visions, and the diviners
shall be confounded: and they shall all cover their faces, because there
is no answer of God.</p>

<p>3:8. But yet I am filled with the strength of the spirit of the Lord,
with judgment and power: to declare unto Jacob his wickedness and to
Israel his sin.</p>

<p>3:9. Hear this, ye princes of the house of Jacob, and ye judges of the
house of Israel: you that abhor judgment and pervert all that is right.</p>

<p>3:10. You that build up Sion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</p>

<p>3:11. Her princes have judged for bribes: and her priests have taught
for hire, and her prophets divined for money: and they leaned upon the
Lord, saying: Is not the Lord in the midst of us? no evil shall come
among us.</p>

<p>3:12. Therefore because of you, Sion shall be ploughed as a field, and
Jerusalem shall be as a heap of stones, and the mountain of the temple
as the high places of the forests.</p>

<p>Micheas Chapter 4</p>

<p>The glory of the church of Christ, by the conversion of the Gentiles.
The Jews shall be carried captives to Babylon, and be delivered again.</p>

<p>4:1. And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of
the house of the Lord shall be prepared in the top of the mountains, and
high above the hills: and people shall flow to it.</p>

<p>4:2. And many nations shall come in haste, and say: Come, let us go up
to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob: and
he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law
shall go forth out of Sion, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>4:3. And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations
afar off: and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their
spears into spades: nation shall not take sword against nation: neither
shall they learn war anymore.</p>

<p>Neither shall they learn, etc... The law of Christ is a law of peace;
and all his true subjects, as much as lies in them love and keep peace
with all the world.</p>

<p>4:4. And every man shall sit under his vine, and under his fig tree, and
there shall be none to make them afraid, for the mouth of the Lord of
hosts hath spoken.</p>

<p>4:5. For all people will walk every one in the name of his god: but we
will walk in the name of the Lord, our God, for ever and ever.</p>

<p>4:6. In that day, saith the Lord, I will gather up her that halteth: and
her that I had cast out, I will gather up: and her whom I had afflicted.</p>

<p>4:7. And I will make her that halted, a remnant: and her that had been
afflicted, a mighty nation: and the Lord will reign over them in Mount
Sion, from this time now and forever.</p>

<p>4:8. And thou, O cloudy tower of the flock, of the daughter of Sion,
unto thee shall it come: yea the first power shall come, the kingdom to
the daughter of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>4:9. Now, why art thou drawn together with grief? Hast thou no king in
thee, or is thy counselor perished, because sorrow hath taken thee as a
woman in labour.</p>

<p>4:10. Be in pain and labour, O daughter of Sion, as a woman that
bringeth forth: for now shalt thou go out of the city, and shalt dwell
in the country, and shalt come even to Babylon, there thou shalt be
delivered: there the Lord will redeem thee out of the hand of thy
enemies.</p>

<p>4:11. And now many nations are gathered together against thee, and they
say: Let her be stoned: and let our eye look upon Sion.</p>

<p>4:12. But they have not known the thoughts of the Lord, and have not
understood his counsel: because he hath gathered them together as the
hay of the floor.</p>

<p>4:13. Arise, and tread, O daughter of Sion: for I will make thy horn
iron, and thy hoofs I will make brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces
many peoples, and shalt immolate the spoils of them to the Lord, and
their strength to the Lord of the whole earth.</p>

<p>Micheas Chapter 5</p>

<p>The birth of Christ in Bethlehem: his reign and spiritual conquests.</p>

<p>5:1. Now shalt thou be laid waste, O daughter of the robber: they have
laid siege against us, with a rod shall they strike the cheek of the
judge of Israel.</p>

<p>Daughter of the robber... Some understand this of Babylon; which robbed
and pillaged the temple of God: others understand it of Jerusalem; by
reason of the many rapines and oppressions committed there.</p>

<p>5:2. And thou Bethlehem Ephrata, art a little one among the thousands of
Juda, out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be the ruler in
Israel: and his going forth is from the beginning, from the days of
eternity.</p>

<p>His going forth, etc... That is, he who as man shall be born in thee, as
God was born of his Father from all eternity.</p>

<p>5:3. Therefore will he give them up even till the time wherein she that
travaileth shall bring forth: and the remnant of his brethren shall be
converted to the children of Israel.</p>

<p>5:4. And he shall stand, and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the
height of the name of the Lord, his God: and they shall be converted,
for now shall he be magnified even to the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>5:5. And this man shall be our peace, when the Assyrian shall come into
our land, and when he shall set his foot in our houses: and we shall
raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.</p>

<p>The Assyrian... That is, the persecutors of the church: who are here
called Assyrians by the prophet: because the Assyrians were at that time
the chief enemies and persecutors of the people of God.-Ibid. Seven
shepherds, etc... Viz., the pastors of God's church, and the defenders
of the faith. The number seven in scripture is taken to signify many:
and when eight is joined with it, we are to understand that the number
will be very great.</p>

<p>5:6. And they shall feed the land of Assyria with the sword, and the
land of Nemrod with the spears thereof: and he shall deliver us from the
Assyrian when he shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in
our borders.</p>

<p>They shall feed, etc... They shall make spiritual conquests in the lands
of their persecutors, with the word of the spirit, which is the word of
God. Eph. 6.17.</p>

<p>5:7. And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples, as
a dew from the Lord, and as drops upon the grass, which waiteth not for
man, nor tarrieth for the children of men.</p>

<p>The remnant of Jacob... Viz., the apostles, and the first preachers of
the Jewish nation; whose doctrine, like dew, shall make the plants of
the converted Gentiles grow up, without waiting for any man to cultivate
them by human learning.</p>

<p>5:8. And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles, in the midst
of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forests, and as a
young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, when he shall go through, and
tread down, and take there is none to deliver.</p>

<p>As a lion, etc... This denotes the fortitude of these first preachers;
and their success in their spiritual enterprises.</p>

<p>5:9. Thy hand shall be lifted up over thy enemies, and all thy enemies
shall be cut off.</p>

<p>5:10. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will
take away thy horses out of the midst of thee, and will destroy thy
chariots.</p>

<p>I will take away thy horses, etc... Some understand this, and all that
follows to the end of the chapter, as addressed to the enemies of the
church. But it may as well be understood of the converts to the church:
who should no longer put their trust in any of these things.</p>

<p>5:11. And I will destroy the cities of thy land, and will throw down all
thy strong holds, and I will take away sorceries out of thy hand, and
there shall be no divinations in thee.</p>

<p>5:12. And I will destroy thy graven things, and thy statues, out of the
midst of thee: and thou shalt no more adore the works of thy hands.</p>

<p>5:13. And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: and will
crush thy cities.</p>

<p>5:14. And I will execute vengeance in wrath, and in indignation, among
all the nations that have not given ear.</p>

<p>Micheas Chapter 6</p>

<p>God expostulates with the Jews for their ingratitude and sins: for which
they shall be punished.</p>

<p>6:1. Hear ye what the Lord saith: Arise, contend thou in judgment
against the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</p>

<p>The mountains, etc... That is, the great ones, the princes of the
people.</p>

<p>6:2. Let the mountains hear the judgment of the Lord, and the strong
foundations of the earth: for the Lord will enter into judgment with his
people, and he will plead against Israel.</p>

<p>6:3. O my people, what have I done to thee, or in what have I molested
thee? answer thou me.</p>

<p>6:4. For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and delivered thee
out of the house of slaves: and I sent before thy face Moses, and Aaron,
and Mary.</p>

<p>6:5. O my people, remember, I pray thee, what Balach, the king of Moab,
purposed: and what Balaam, the son of Beor, answered him, from Setim to
Galgal, that thou mightest know the justice of the Lord.</p>

<p>From Setim to Galgal... He puts them in mind of the favour he did them,
in not suffering them to be quite destroyed by the evil purpose of
Balach, and the wicked counsel of Balaam: and then gives them a hint of
the wonders he wrought, in order to bring them into the land of Promise,
by stopping the course of the Jordan, in their march from Setim to
Galgal.</p>

<p>6:6. What shall I offer to the Lord that is worthy? wherewith shall I
kneel before the high God? shall I offer holocausts unto him, and calves
of a year old?</p>

<p>What shall I offer, etc... This is spoken in the person of the people,
desiring to be informed what they are to do to please God.</p>

<p>6:7. May the Lord be appeased with thousands of rams, or with many
thousands of fat he goats? shall I give my firstborn for my wickedness,
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</p>

<p>6:8. I will shew thee, O man, what is good, and what the Lord requireth
of thee: Verily to do judgment, and to love mercy, and to walk
solicitous with thy God.</p>

<p>6:9. The voice of the Lord crieth to the city, and salvation shall be to
them that fear thy name: hear O ye tribes, and who shall approve it?</p>

<p>6:10. As yet there is a fire in the house of the wicked, the treasures
of iniquity, and a scant measure full of wrath.</p>

<p>Full of wrath, etc... That is, highly provoking in the sight of God.</p>

<p>6:11. Shall I justify wicked balances, and the deceitful weights of the
bag?</p>

<p>6:12. By which her rich men were filled with iniquity, and the
inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue was deceitful in
their mouth.</p>

<p>6:13. And I therefore began to strike thee with desolation for thy sins.</p>

<p>6:14. Thou shalt eat, but shalt not be filled: and thy humiliation shall
be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not save:
and those whom thou shalt save, I will give up to the sword.</p>

<p>6:15. Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap: thou shalt tread the olives,
but shalt not be anointed with oil: and the new wine, but shalt not
drink the wine.</p>

<p>6:16. For thou hast kept the statutes of Amri, and all the works of the
house of Achab: and thou hast walked according their wills, that I
should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing,
and you shall bear the reproach of my people.</p>

<p>The statutes of Amri, etc... The wicked ways of Amri and Achab,
idolatrous kings.</p>

<p>Micheas Chapter 7</p>

<p>The prophet laments, that notwithstanding all his preaching, the
generality are still corrupt in their manners: therefore their
desolation is at hand: but they shall be restored again and prosper; and
all mankind shall be redeemed by Christ.</p>

<p>7:1. Woe is me, for I am become as one that gleaneth in autumn the
grapes of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat, my soul desired the
first ripe figs.</p>

<p>7:2. The holy man is perished out of the earth, and there is none
upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood, every one hunteth his
brother to death.</p>

<p>7:3. The evil of their hands they call good: the prince requireth, and
the judge is for giving: and the great man hath uttered the desire of
his soul, and they have troubled it.</p>

<p>7:4. He that is best among them, is as a brier, and he that is
righteous, as the thorn of the hedge. The day of thy inspection, thy
visitation cometh: now shall be their destruction.</p>

<p>7:5. Believe not a friend, and trust not in a prince: keep the doors of
thy mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom.</p>

<p>7:6. For the son dishonoureth the father, and the daughter riseth up
against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law: and a
man's enemies are they of his own household.</p>

<p>7:7. But I will look towards the Lord, I will wait for God, my saviour:
my God will hear me.</p>

<p>7:8. Rejoice not, thou my enemy, over me, because I am fallen: I shall
arise, when I sit in darkness, the Lord is my light.</p>

<p>7:9. I will bear the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against
him: until he judge my cause, and execute judgement for me: he will
bring me forth into the light, I shall behold his justice.</p>

<p>7:10. And my enemy shall behold, and she shall be covered with shame,
who saith to me: Where is the Lord thy God? my eyes shall look down upon
her: now shall she be trodden under foot as the mire of the streets.</p>

<p>She shall be covered, etc... Viz., Babylon my enemy.</p>

<p>7:11. The day shall come, that thy walls may be built up: in that day
shall the law be far removed.</p>

<p>The law... Viz., of thy enemies, who have tyrannized over thee.</p>

<p>7:12. In that day they shall come even from Assyria to thee, and to the
fortified cities: and from the fortified cities even to the river, and
from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.</p>

<p>7:13. And the land shall be made desolate because of the inhabitants

<p>The land, etc... Viz., of Babylon.</p>

<p>7:14. Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy inheritance, them
that dwell alone in the forest, in the midst of Carmel: they shall feed

</p>
<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
