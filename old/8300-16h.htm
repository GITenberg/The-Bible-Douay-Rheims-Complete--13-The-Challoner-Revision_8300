<p>THE BOOK OF NEHEMIAS, WHICH IS CALLED THE SECOND OF ESDRAS</p>

<p>This Book takes its name from the writer, who was cupbearer to
Artaxerxes (surnamed Longimanus) king of Persia, and was sent by him
with a commission to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. It is also called
the second book of Esdras; because it is a continuation of the history,
begun by Esdras, of the state of the people of God after their return
from captivity.</p>

<p>
2 Esdras Chapter 1</p>

<p>Nehemias hearing the miserable state of his countrymen in Judea,
lamenteth, fasteth, and prayeth to God for their relief.</p>

<p>1:1. The words of Nehemias the son of Helchias. And it came to pass in
the month of Casleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in the castle of
Susa,</p>

<p>1:2. That Hanani one of my brethren came, he and some men of Juda; and I
asked them concerning the Jews, that remained and were left of the
captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</p>

<p>1:3. And they said to me: They that have remained, and are left of the
captivity there in the province, are in great affliction, and reproach:
and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and the gates thereof are
burnt with fire.</p>

<p>1:4. And when I had heard these words, I sat down, and wept, and mourned
for many days: and I fasted, and prayed before the face of the God of
heaven.</p>

<p>1:5. And I said: I beseech thee, O Lord God of heaven, strong, great,
and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy with those that love thee,
and keep thy commandments:</p>

<p>1:6. Let thy ears be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the prayer of
thy servant, which I pray before thee now, night and day, for the
children of Israel thy servants: and I confess the sins of the children
of Israel, by which they have sinned against thee: I and my father's
house have sinned.</p>

<p>1:7. We have been seduced by vanity, and have not kept thy commandments,
and ceremonies and judgments, which thou hast commanded thy servant
Moses.</p>

<p>1:8. Remember the word that thou commandedst to Moses thy servant,
saying: If you shall transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the
nations:</p>

<p>1:9. But if you return to me, and keep my commandments, and do them,
though you should be led away to the uttermost parts of the world, I
will gather you from thence, and bring you back to the place which I
have chosen for my name to dwell there.</p>

<p>1:10. And these are thy servants, and thy people: whom thou hast
redeemed by thy great strength, and by thy mighty hand.</p>

<p>1:11. I beseech thee, O Lord, let thy ear be attentive to the prayer of
thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy
name: and direct thy servant this day, and give him mercy before this
man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</p>

<p>2 Esdras Chapter 2</p>

<p>Nehemias with commission from king Artaxerxes cometh to Jerusalem: and
exhorteth the Jews to rebuild the walls.</p>

<p>2:1. And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of
Artaxerxes the king: that wine was before him, and I took up the wine,
and gave it to the king: and I was as one languishing away before his
face.</p>

<p>2:2. And the king said to me: Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou
dost not appear to be sick? this is not without cause, but some evil, I
know not what, is in thy heart. And I was seized with an exceeding great
fear:</p>

<p>2:3. And I said to the king: O king, live for ever: why should not my
countenance be sorrowful, seeing the city of the place of the sepulchres
of my fathers is desolate, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire?</p>

<p>2:4. Then the king said to me: For what dost thou make request? &nbsp;And I
prayed to the God of heaven,</p>

<p>2:5. And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, and if thy
servant hath found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me into
Judea to the city of the sepulchre of my father, and I will build it.</p>

<p>2:6. And the king said to me, and the queen that sat by him: For how
long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? And it pleased the
king, and he sent me: and I fixed him a time.</p>

<p>2:7. And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, let him give
me letters to the governors of the country beyond the river, that they
convey me over, till I come into Judea:</p>

<p>2:8. And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, to give me
timber that I may cover the gates of the tower of the house, and the
walls of the city, and the house that I shall enter into. And the king
gave me according to the good hand of my God with me.</p>

<p>2:9. And I came to the governors of the country beyond the river, and
gave them the king's letters. And the king had sent with me captains of
soldiers, and horsemen.</p>

<p>2:10. And Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the Ammonite,
heard it, and it grieved them exceedingly, that a man was come, who
sought the prosperity of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>2:11. And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</p>

<p>2:12. And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me, and I told
not any man what God had put in my heart to do in Jerusalem, and there
was no beast with me, but the beast that I rode upon.</p>

<p>2:13. And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, and before the
dragon fountain, and to the dung gate, and I viewed the wall of
Jerusalem which was broken down, and the gates thereof which were
consumed with fire.</p>

<p>2:14. And I passed to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's
aqueduct, and there was no place for the beast on which I rode to pass.</p>

<p>2:15. And I went up in the night by the torrent, and viewed the wall,
and going back I came to the gate of the valley, and returned.</p>

<p>2:16. But the magistrates knew not whither I went, or what I did:
neither had I as yet told any thing to the Jews, or to the priests, or
to the nobles, or to the magistrates, or to the rest that did the work.</p>

<p>2:17. Then I said to them: You know the affliction wherein we are,
because Jerusalem is desolate, and the gates thereof are consumed with
fire: come, and let us build up the walls of Jerusalem, and let us be no
longer a reproach.</p>

<p>2:18. And I shewed them how the hand of my God was good with me, and the
king's words, which he had spoken to me, and I said: Let us rise up, and
build. And their hands were strengthened in good.</p>

<p>2:19. But Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the Ammonite,
and Gossem the Arabian heard of it, and they scoffed at us, and despised
us, and said: What is this thing that you do? are you going to rebel
against the king?</p>

<p>2:20. And I answered them, and said to them: The God of heaven he
helpeth us, and we are his servants: let us rise up and build: but you
have no part, nor justice, nor remembrance in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>2 Esdras Chapter 3</p>

<p>They begin to build the walls: the names and order of the builders.</p>

<p>3:1. Then Eliasib the high priest arose, and his brethren the priests,
and they built the flock gate: they sanctified it, and set up the doors
thereof, even unto the tower of a hundred cubits they sanctified it unto
the tower of Hananeel.</p>

<p>3:2. And next to him the men of Jericho built: and next to them built
Zachur the son of Amri.</p>

<p>3:3. But the fish gate the sons of Asnaa built: they covered it, and set
up the doors thereof, and the locks, and the bars. &nbsp;And next to them
built Marimuth the son of Urias the son of Accus.</p>

<p>4. And next to him built Mosollam the son of Barachias, the son of
Merezebel, and next to them built Sadoc the son of Baana.</p>

<p>5. And next to them the Thecuites built: but their great men did not put
their necks to the work of their Lord.</p>

<p>3:6. And Joiada the son of Phasea, and Mosollam the son of Besodia built
the old gate: they covered it and set up the doors thereof, and the
locks, and the bars.</p>

<p>3:7. And next to them built Meltias the Gabaonite, and Jadon the
Meronathite, the men of Gabaon and Maspha, for the governor that was in
the country beyond the river.</p>

<p>3:8. And next to him built Eziel the son of Araia the goldsmith: and
next to him built Ananias the son of the perfumer: and they left
Jerusalem unto the wall of the broad street.</p>

<p>3:9. And next to him built Raphaia the son of Hur, lord of the street of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>3:10. And next to him Jedaia the son of Haromaph over against his own
house: and next to him built Hattus the son of Hasebonia.</p>

<p>3:11. Melchias the son of Herem, and Hasub the son of Phahath Moab,
built half the street, and the tower of the furnaces.</p>

<p>3:12. And next to him built Sellum the son of Alohes, lord of half the
street of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.</p>

<p>3:13. And the gate of the valley Hanun built, and the inhabitants of
Zanoe: they built it, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks, and
the bars, and a thousand cubits in the wall unto the gate of the
dunghill.</p>

<p>3:14. And the gate of the dunghill Melchias the son of Rechab built,
lord of the street of Bethacharam: he built it, and set up the doors
thereof, and the locks, and the bars.</p>

<p>3:15. And the gate of the fountain, Sellum, the son of Cholhoza, built,
lord of the street of Maspha: he built it, and covered it, and set up
the doors thereof, and the locks, and the bars, and the walls of the
pool of Siloe unto the king's guard, and unto the steps that go down
from the city of David.</p>

<p>3:16. After him built Nehemias the son of Azboc, lord of half the street
of Bethsur, as far as over against the sepulchre of David, and to the
pool, that was built with great labour, and to the house of the mighty.</p>

<p>3:17. After him built the Levites, Rehum the son of Benni. After him
built Hasebias, lord of half the street of Ceila in his own street.</p>

<p>3:18. After him built their brethren Bavai the son of Enadad, lord of
half Ceila.</p>

<p>3:19. And next to him Aser the son of Josue, lord of Maspha, built
another measure, over against the going up of the strong corner.</p>

<p>3:20. After him in the mount Baruch the son of Zachai built another
measure, from the corner to the door of the house of Eliasib the high
priest.</p>

<p>3:21. After him Merimuth the son of Urias the son of Haccus, built
another measure, from the door of the house of Eliasib, to the end of
the house of Eliasib.</p>

<p>3:22. And after him built the priests, the men of the plains of the
Jordan.</p>

<p>3:23. After him built Benjamin and Hasub, over against their own house:
and after him built Azarias the son of Maasias the son of Ananias over
against his house.</p>

<p>3:24. After him built Bennui the son of Hanadad another measure, from
the house of Azarias unto the bending, and unto the corner.</p>

<p>3:25. Phalel, the son of Ozi, over against the bending and the tower,
which lieth out from the king's high house, that is, in the court of the
prison: after him Phadaia the son of Pharos.</p>

<p>3:26. And the Nathinites dwelt in Ophel, as far as over against the
water gate toward the east, and the tower that stood out.</p>

<p>3:27. After him the Thecuites built another measure over against, from
the great tower that standeth out unto the wall of the temple.</p>

<p>3:28. And upward from the horse gate the priests built, every man over
against his house.</p>

<p>3:29. After them built Sadoc the son of Emmer over against his house.
And after him built Semaia the son of Sechenias, keeper of the east
gate.</p>

<p>3:30. After him built Hanania the son of Selemia, and Hanun the sixth
son of Seleph, another measure: after him built Mosollam the son of
Barachias over against his treasury. After him Melcias the goldsmith's
son built unto the house of the Nathinites, and of the sellers of small
wares, over against the judgment gate, and unto the chamber of the
corner.</p>

<p>3:31. And within the chamber of the corner of the flock gate, the
goldsmiths and the merchants built.</p>

<p>2 Esdras Chapter 4</p>

<p>The building is carried on notwithstanding the opposition of their
enemies.</p>

<p>4:1. And it came to pass, that when Sanaballat heard that we were
building the wall he was angry: and being moved exceedingly he scoffed
at the Jews.</p>

<p>4:2. And said before his brethren, and the multitude of the Samaritans:
What are the silly Jews doing? Will the Gentiles let them alone? will
they sacrifice and make an end in a day? are they able to raise stones
out of the heaps of the rubbish, which are burnt?</p>

<p>4:3. Tobias also the Ammonite who was by him said: Let them build: if a
fox go up, he will leap over their stone wall.</p>

<p>4:4. Hear thou our God, for we are despised: turn their reproach upon
their own head, and give them to be despised in a land of captivity.</p>

<p>4:5. Cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from
before thy face, because they have mocked thy builders.</p>

<p>4:6. So we built the wall, and joined it all together unto the half
thereof: and the heart of the people was excited to work.</p>

<p>4:7. And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and the Arabians,
and the Ammonites, and the Azotians heard that the walls of Jerusalem
were made up, and the breaches began to be closed, that they were
exceedingly angry.</p>

<p>4:8. And they all assembled themselves together, to come, and to fight
against Jerusalem, and to prepare ambushes.</p>

<p>4:9. And we prayed to our God, and set watchmen upon the wall day and
night against them.</p>

<p>4:10. And Juda said: The strength of the bearer of burdens is decayed,
and the rubbish is very much, and we shall not be able to build the
wall.</p>

<p>4:11. And our enemies said: Let them not know, nor understand, till we
come in the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.</p>

<p>4:12. And it came to pass, that when the Jews that dwelt by them came
and told us ten times, out of all the places from whence they came to
us,</p>

<p>4:13. I set the people in the place behind the wall round about in
order, with their swords, and spears, and bows.</p>

<p>4:14. And I looked and rose up: and I said to the chief men and the
magistrates, and to the rest of the common people: be not afraid of
them. Remember the Lord who is great and terrible, and fight for your
brethren, your sons, and your daughters, and your wives, and your
houses.</p>

<p>4:15. And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that the thing had
been told us, that God defeated their counsel. And we returned all of us
to the walls, every man to his work.</p>

<p>4:16. And it came to pass from that day forward, that half of their
young men did the work, and half were ready for to fight, with spears,
and shields, and bows, and coats of mail, and the rulers were behind
them in all the house of Juda.</p>

<p>4:17. Of them that built on the wall and that carried burdens, and that
laded: with one of his hands he did the work, and with the other he held
a sword.</p>

<p>4:18. For every one of the builders was girded with a sword about his
reins. And they built, and sounded with a trumpet by me.</p>

<p>4:19. And I said to the nobles, and to the magistrates, and to the rest
of the common people: The work is great and wide, and we are separated
on the wall one far from another:</p>

<p>4:20. In what place soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, run
all thither unto us: our God will fight for us.</p>

<p>4:21. And let us do the work: and let one half of us hold our spears
from the rising of the morning, till the stars appear.</p>

<p>4:22. At that time also I said to the people: Let every one with his
servant stay in the midst of Jerusalem, and let us take our turns in the
night, and by day, to work.</p>

<p>4:23. Now I and my brethren, and my servants, and the watchmen that
followed me, did not put off our clothes: only every man stripped
himself when he was to be washed.</p>

<p>2 Esdras Chapter 5</p>

<p>Nehemias blameth the rich, for their oppressing the poor. His
exhortation, and bounty to his countrymen.</p>

<p>5:1. Now there was a great cry of the people, and of their wives against
their brethren the Jews.</p>

<p>5:2. And there were some that said: Our sons and our daughters are very
many: let us take up corn for the price of them, and let us eat and
live.</p>

<p>5:3. And there were some that said: Let us mortgage our lands, and our
vineyards, and our houses, and let us take corn because of the famine.</p>

<p>5:4. And others said: Let us borrow money for the king's tribute, and
let us give up our fields and vineyards:</p>

<p>5:5. And now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren: and our children
as their children. Behold we bring into bondage our sons and our
daughters, and some of our daughters are bondwomen already, neither have
we wherewith to redeem them, and our fields and our vineyards other men
possess.</p>

<p>5:6. And I was exceedingly angry when I heard their cry according to
these words.</p>

<p>5:7. And my heart thought with myself: and I rebuked the nobles and
magistrates, and said to them: Do you every one exact usury of your
brethren? And I gathered together a great assembly against them,</p>

<p>5:8. And I said to them: We, as you know, have redeemed according to our
ability our brethren the Jews, that were sold to the Gentiles: and will
you then sell your brethren, for us to redeem them? And they held their
peace, and found not what to answer.</p>

<p>5:9. And I said to them: The thing you do is not good: why walk you not
in the fear of our God, that we be not exposed to the reproaches of the
Gentiles our enemies?</p>

<p>5:10. Both I and my brethren, and my servants, have lent money and corn
to many: let us all agree not to call for it again; let us forgive the
debt that is owing to us.</p>

<p>5:11. Restore ye to them this day their fields, and their vineyards, and
their oliveyards, and their houses: and the hundredth part of the money,
and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, which you were wont to exact of
them, give it rather for them.</p>

<p>5:12. And they said: We will restore, and we will require nothing of
them: and we will do as thou sayest. And I called the priests and took
an oath of them, to do according to what I had said.</p>

<p>5:13. Moreover I shook my lap, and said: So may God shake every man that
shall not accomplish this word, out of his house, and out of his
labours, thus may he be shaken out, and become empty. &nbsp;And all the
multitude said: Amen. And they praised God. And the people did according
to what was said.</p>

<p>5:14. And from the day, in which the king commanded me to be governor in
the land of Juda, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth
year of Artaxerxes the king, for twelve years, I and my brethren did not
eat the yearly allowance that was due to the governors.</p>

<p>5:15. But the former governors that had been before me, were chargeable
to the people, and took of them in bread, and wine, and in money every
day forty sicles: and their officers also oppressed the people. But I
did not so for the fear of God.</p>

<p>5:16. Moreover I built in the work of the wall, and I bought no land,
and all my servants were gathered together to the work.</p>

<p>5:17. The Jews also and the magistrates to the number of one hundred and
fifty men, were at my table, besides them that came to us from among the
nations that were round about us.</p>

<p>5:18. And there was prepared for me day be day one ox, and six choice
rams, besides fowls, and once in ten days I gave store of divers wines,
and many other things: yet I did not require my yearly allowance as
governor: for the people were very much impoverished.</p>

<p>5:19. Remember me, O my God, for good according to all that I have done
for this people.</p>

<p>2 Esdras Chapter 6</p>

<p>The enemies seek to terrify Nehemias. He proceedeth and finisheth the
wall.</p>

<p>6:1. And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and Gossem the
Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall,
and that there was no breach left in it, (though at that time I had not
set up the doors in the gates,)</p>

<p>6:2. Sanaballat and Gossem sent to me, saying: Come, and let us make a
league together in the villages, in the plain of Ono. &nbsp;But they thought
to do me mischief.</p>

<p>6:3. And I sent messengers to them, saying: I am doing a great work, and
I cannot come down, lest it be neglected whilst I come, and go down to
you.</p>

<p>6:4. And they sent to me according to this word, four times: and I
answered them after the same manner.</p>

<p>6:5. And Sanaballat sent his servant to me the fifth time according to
the former word, and he had a letter in his hand written in this manner:</p>

<p>6:6. It is reported amongst the Gentiles, and Gossem hath said it, that
thou and the Jews think to rebel, and therefore thou buildest the wall,
and hast a mind to set thyself king over them: for which end</p>

<p>6:7. Thou hast also set up prophets, to preach of thee at Jerusalem,
saying: There is a king in Judea. The king will hear of these things:
therefore come now, that we may take counsel together.</p>

<p>6:8. And I sent to them, saying: There is no such thing done as thou
sayest: but thou feignest these things out of thy own heart.</p>

<p>6:9. For all these men thought to frighten us, thinking that our hands
would cease from the work, and that we would leave off. &nbsp;Wherefore I
strengthened my hands the more:</p>

<p>6:10. And I went into the house of Samaia the son of Delaia, the son of
Metabeel privately. And he said: Let us consult together in the house of
God in the midst of the temple: and let us shut the doors of the temple,
for they will come to kill thee, and in the night they will come to slay
thee.</p>

<p>6:11. And I said: Should such a man as I flee? and who is there that
being as I am, would go into the temple, to save his life? &nbsp;I will not
go in.</p>

<p>6:12. And I understood that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken
to me as if he had been prophesying, and Tobias, and Sanaballat had
hired him.</p>

<p>6:13. For he had taken money, that I being afraid should do this thing,
and sin, and they might have some evil to upbraid me withal.</p>

<p>6:14. Remember me, O Lord, for Tobias and Sanaballat, according to their
works of this kind: and Noadias the prophet, and the rest of the
prophets that would have put me in fear.</p>

<p>6:15. But the wall was finished the five and twentieth day of the month
of Elul, in two and fifty days.</p>

<p>6:16. And it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it, that all
nations which were round about us, were afraid, and were cast down
within themselves, for they perceived that this work was the work of
God.</p>

<p>6:17. Moreover in those days many letters were sent by the principal men
of the Jews to Tobias, and from Tobias there came letters to them.</p>

<p>6:18. For there were many in Judea sworn to him, because he was the son
in law of Sechenias the son of Area, and Johanan his son had taken to
wife the daughter of Mosollam the son of Barachias.</p>

<p>6:19. And they praised him also before me, and they related my words to
him: And Tobias sent letters to put me in fear.</p>

<p>2 Esdras Chapter 7</p>

<p>Nehemias appointeth watchmen in Jerusalem. The list of those who came
first from Babylon.</p>

<p>7:1. Now after the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and
numbered the porters and singing men, and Levites:</p>

<p>7:2. I commanded Hanani my brother, and Hananias ruler of the house of
Jerusalem, (for he seemed as a sincere man, and one that feared God
above the rest,)</p>

<p>7:3. And I said to them: Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened till
the sun be hot. And while they were yet standing by the gates were shut,
and barred: and I set watchmen of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every
one by their courses, and every man over against his house.</p>

<p>7:4. And the city was very wide and great, and the people few in the
midst thereof, and the houses were not built.</p>

<p>7:5. But God had put in my heart, and I assembled the princes and
magistrates, and common people, to number them: and I found a book of
the number of them who came up at first and therein it was found
written:</p>

<p>7:6. These are the children of the province, who came up from the
captivity of them that had been carried away, whom Nabuchodonosor the
king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned into Judea, every one
into his own city.</p>

<p>7:7. Who came with Zorobabel, Josue, Nehemias, Azarias, Raamias,
Nahamani, Mardochai, Belsam, Mespharath, Begoia, Nahum, Baana. &nbsp;The
number of the men of the people of Israel:</p>

<p>7:8. The children of Pharos, two thousand one hundred seventy-two.</p>

<p>7:9. The children of Sephatia, three hundred seventy-two.</p>

<p>7:10. The children of Area, six hundred fifty-two.</p>

<p>7:11. The children of Phahath Moab of the children of Josue and Joab,
two thousand eight hundred eighteen.</p>

<p>7:26. The children of Bethlehem, and Netupha, a hundred eighty-eight.</p>

<p>7:27. The men of Anathoth, a hundred twenty-eight.</p>

three.</p>

<p>7:31. The men of Machmas, a hundred twenty-two.</p>

<p>7:32. The men of Bethel and Hai, a hundred twenty-three.</p>

<p>7:33. The men of the other Nebo, fifty-two.</p>

<p>7:34. The men of the other Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty-four.</p>

hundred and seventy-three.</p>

<p>7:42. The children of Arem, one thousand and seventeen. The Levites:</p>

<p>7:43. The children of Josue and Cedmihel, the sons</p>

<p>7:44. Of Oduia, seventy-four. The singing men:</p>

<p>7:45. The children of Asaph, a hundred forty-eight.</p>

<p>7:46. The porters: the children of Sellum, the children of Ater, the
children of Telmon, the children of Accub, the children of Hatita, the
children of Sobai: a hundred thirty-eight.</p>

<p>7:47. The Nathinites: the children of Soha, the children of Hasupha, the
children of Tebbaoth,</p>

<p>7:48. The children of Ceros, the children os Siaa, the children of
Phadon, the children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children of
Selmai,</p>

<p>7:49. The children of Hanan, the children of Geddel, the children of
Gaher,</p>

<p>7:50. The children of Raaia, the children of Rasin, the children of
Necoda,</p>

<p>7:51. The children of Gezem, the children of Asa, the children of
Phasea,</p>

<p>7:52. The children of Besai, the children of Munim, the children of
Nephussim,</p>

<p>7:53. The children of Bacbuc, the children of Hacupha, the children of
Harhur,</p>

<p>7:54. The children of Besloth, the children of Mahida, the children of
Harsa,</p>

<p>7:55. The children of Bercos, the children of Sisara, the children of
Thema,</p>

<p>7:56. The children of Nasia, the children of Hatipha,</p>

<p>7:57. The children of the servants of Solomon, the children of Sothai,
the children of Sophereth, the children of Pharida,</p>

<p>7:58. The children of Jahala, the children of Darcon, the children of
Jeddel,</p>

<p>7:59. The children of Saphatia, the children of Hatil, the children of
Phochereth, who was born of Sabaim, the son of Amon.</p>

<p>7:60. All the Nathinites, and the children of the servants of Solomon,
three hundred ninety-two.</p>

<p>7:61. And these are they that came up from Telmela, Thelharsa, Cherub,
Addon, and Emmer: and could not shew the house of their fathers, nor
their seed, whether they were of Israel.</p>

<p>7:62. The children of Dalaia, the children of Tobia, the children of
Necoda, six hundred forty-two.</p>

<p>7:63. And of the priests, the children of Habia, the children of Accos,
the children of Berzellai, who took a wife of the daughters of Berzellai
the Galaadite, and he was called by their name.</p>

<p>7:64. These sought their writing in the record, and found it not: and
they were cast out of the priesthood.</p>

<p>7:65. And Athersatha said to them, that they should not eat of the
holies of holies, until there stood up a priest learned and skilful.</p>

<p>7:66. All the multitude as it were one man, forty-two thousand three
hundred sixty,</p>

<p>7:67. Beside their menservants and womenservants, who were seven
thousand three hundred thirty-seven: and among them singing men, and
singing women, two hundred forty-five.</p>

<p>7:68. Their horses, seven hundred thirty-six: their mules two hundred
forty-five.</p>

<p>7:69. Their camels, four hundred thirty-five, their asses, six thousand
seven hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>(Hitherto is related what was written in the record. From this place
forward goeth on the history of Nehemias.)</p>

<p>7:70. And some of the heads of the families gave unto the work.
Athersatha gave into the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty bowls,
and five hundred and thirty garments for priests.</p>

<p>Athersatha... That is, Nehemias; as appears from chap. 12. Either that
he was so called at the court of the king of Persia, where he was
cupbearer: or that, as some think, this name signifies governor; and he
was at that time governor of Judea.</p>

<p>7:71. And some of the heads of families gave to the treasure of the
work, twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand two hundred pounds
of silver.</p>

<p>7:72. And that which the rest of the people gave, was twenty thousand
drams of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and sixty-seven
garments for priests.</p>

<p>7:73. And the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singing
men, and the rest of the common people, and the Nathinites, and all
Israel dwelt in their cities.</p>

<p>2 Esdras Chapter 8</p>

<p>Esdras readeth the law before the people. Nehemias comforteth them. They
celebrate the feast of tabernacles.</p>

<p>8:1. And the seventh month came: and the children of Israel were in
their cities. And all the people were gathered together as one man to
the street which is before the water gate, and they spoke to Esdras the
scribe, to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had
commanded to Israel.</p>

<p>8:2. Then Esdras the priest brought the law before the multitude of men
and women, and all those that could understand, in the first day of the
seventh month.</p>

<p>8:3. And he read it plainly in the street that was before the water
gate, from the morning until midday, before the men, and the women, and
all those that could understand: and the ears of all the people were
attentive to the book.</p>

<p>8:4. And Esdras the scribe stood upon a step of wood, which he had made
to speak upon, and there stood by him Mathathias, and Semeia, and Ania,
and Uria, and Helcia, and Maasia, on his right hand: and on the left,
Phadaia, Misael, and Melchia, and Hasum, and Hasbadana, Zacharia and
Mosollam.</p>

<p>8:5. And Esdras opened the book before all the people: for he was above
all the people: and when he had opened it, all the people stood.</p>

<p>8:6. And Esdras blessed the Lord the great God: and all the people
answered, Amen, amen: lifting up their hands: and they bowed down, and
adored God with their faces to the ground.</p>

<p>8:7. Now Josue, and Bani, and Serebia, Jamin, Accub, Sephtai, Odia,
Maasia, Celtia, Azarias, Jozabed, Hanan, Phalaia, the Levites, made
silence among the people to hear the law: and the people stood in their
place.</p>

<p>8:8. And they read in the book of the law of God distinctly and plainly
to be understood: and they understood when it was read.</p>

<p>8:9. And Nehemias (he is Athersatha) and Esdras the priest and scribe,
and the Levites who interpreted to all the people, said: This is a holy
day to the Lord our God: do not mourn, nor weep: for all the people
wept, when they heard the words of the law.</p>

<p>8:10. And he said to them: Go, eat fat meats, and drink sweet wine, and
send portions to them that have not prepared for themselves: because it
is the holy day of the Lord, and be not sad: for the joy of the Lord is
our strength.</p>

<p>8:11. And the Levites stilled all the people, saying: Hold your peace,
for the day is holy, and be not sorrowful.</p>

<p>8:12. So all the people went to eat and drink, and to send portions, and
to make great mirth: because they understood the words that he had
taught them.</p>

<p>8:13. And on the second day the chiefs of the families of all the
people, the priests, and the Levites were gathered together to Esdras
the scribe, that he should interpret to them the words of the law.</p>

<p>8:14. And they found written in the law, that the Lord had commanded by
the hand of Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in
tabernacles, on the feast, in the seventh month:</p>

<p>8:15. And that they should proclaim and publish the word in all their
cities, and in Jerusalem, saying: Go forth to the mount, and fetch
branches of olive, and branches of beautiful wood, branches of myrtle,
and branches of palm, and branches of thick trees, to make tabernacles,
as it is written.</p>

<p>8:16. And the people went forth, and brought. And they made themselves
tabernacles every man on the top of his house, and in their courts, and
in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate,
and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.</p>

<p>8:17. And all the assembly of them that were returned from the
captivity, made tabernacles, and dwelt in tabernacles: for since the
days of Josue the son of Nun the children of Israel had not done so,
until that day: and there was exceeding great joy.</p>

<p>8:18. And he read in the book of the law of God day by day, from the
first day till the last, and they kept the solemnity seven days, and in
the eighth day a solemn assembly according to the manner.</p>

<p>2 Esdras Chapter 9</p>

<p>The people repent with fasting and sackcloth. The Levites confess God's
benefits, and the people's ingratitude: they pray for them, and make a
covenant with God.</p>

<p>9:1. And in the four and twentieth day of the month the children of
Israel came together with fasting and with sackcloth, and earth upon
them.</p>

<p>9:2. And the seed of the children of Israel separated themselves from
every stranger: and they stood, and confessed their sins, and the
iniquities of their fathers.</p>

<p>9:3. And they rose up to stand: and they read in the book of the law of
the Lord their God, four times in the day, and four times they
confessed, and adored the Lord their God.</p>

<p>9:4. And there stood up upon the step of the Levites, Josue, and Bani,
and Cedmihel, Sabania, Bonni, Sarebias, Bani, and Chanani: and they
cried with a loud voice to the Lord their God.</p>

<p>9:5. And the Levites Josue and Cedmihel, Bonni, Hasebnia, Serebia,
Oduia, Sebnia, and Phathahia, said: Arise, bless the Lord your God from
eternity to eternity: and blessed be the high name of thy glory with all
blessing and praise.</p>

<p>9:6. Thou thyself, O Lord alone, thou hast made heaven, and the heaven
of heavens, and all the host thereof: the earth and all things that are
in it: the seas and all that are therein: and thou givest life to all
these things, and the host of heaven adoreth thee.</p>

<p>9:7. Thou O Lord God, art he who chosest Abram, and broughtest him forth
out of the fire of the Chaldeans, and gavest him the name of Abraham.</p>

<p>The fire of the Chaldeans... The city of Ur in Chaldea, the name of
which signifies fire. Or out of the fire of the tribulations and
temptations, to which he was there exposed.-The ancient Rabbins
understood this literally, affirming that Abram was cast into the fire
by the idolaters, and brought out by a miracle without any hurt.</p>

<p>9:8. And thou didst find his heart faithful before thee: and thou madest
a covenant with him, to give him the land of the Chanaanite, of the
Hethite, and of the Amorrhite, and of the Pherezite, and of the
Jebusite, and of the Gergezite, to give it to his seed: and thou hast
fulfilled thy words, because thou art just.</p>

<p>9:9. And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt: and thou
didst hear their cry by the Red Sea.</p>

<p>9:10. And thou shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharao, and upon all his
servants, and upon the people of his land: for thou knewest that they
dealt proudly against them: and thou madest thyself a name, as it is at
this day.</p>

<p>9:11. And thou didst divide the sea before them, and they passed through
the midst of the sea on dry land: but their persecutors thou threwest
into the depth, as a stone into mighty waters.</p>

<p>9:12. And in a pillar of a cloud thou wast their leader by day, and in a
pillar of fire by night, that they might see the way by which they went.</p>

<p>9:13. Thou camest down also to mount Sinai, and didst speak with them
from heaven, and thou gavest them right judgments, and the law of truth,
ceremonies, and good precepts.</p>

<p>9:14. Thou madest known to them thy holy sabbath, and didst prescribe to
them commandments, and ceremonies, and the law by the hand of Moses thy
servant.</p>

<p>9:15. And thou gavest them bread from heaven in their hunger, and
broughtest forth water for them out of the rock in their thirst, and
thou saidst to them that they should go in, and possess the land, upon
which thou hadst lifted up thy hand to give it them.</p>

<p>9:16. But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks
and hearkened not to thy commandments.</p>

<p>9:17. And they would not hear, and they remembered not thy wonders which
thou hadst done for them. And they hardened their necks, and gave the
head to return to their bondage, as it were by contention. But thou, a
forgiving God, gracious, and merciful, longsuffering, and full of
compassion, didst not forsake them.</p>

<p>And gave the head... That is, they set their head, or were bent to
return to Egypt.</p>

<p>9:18. Yea when they had made also to themselves a molten calf, and had
said: This is thy God, that brought thee out of Egypt: and had committed
great blasphemies:</p>

<p>9:19. Yet thou, in thy many mercies, didst not leave them in the desert:
the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in
the way, and the pillar of fire by night to shew them the way by which
they should go.</p>

<p>9:20. And thou gavest them thy good Spirit to teach them, and thy manna
thou didst not withhold from their mouth, and thou gavest them water for
their thirst.</p>

<p>9:21. Forty years didst thou feed them in the desert, and nothing was
wanting to them: their garments did not grow old, and their feet were
not worn.</p>

<p>9:22. And thou gavest them kingdoms, and nations, and didst divide lots
for them: and they possessed the land of Sehon, and the land of the king
of Hesebon, and the land of Og king of Basan.</p>

<p>9:23. And thou didst multiply their children as the stars of heaven, and
broughtest them to the land concerning which thou hadst said to their
fathers, that they should go in and possess it.</p>

<p>9:24. And the children came and possessed the land, and thou didst
humble before them the inhabitants of the land, the Chanaanites, and
gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the
land, that they might do with them as it pleased them.</p>

<p>9:25. And they took strong cities and a fat land, and possessed houses
full of all goods: cisterns made by others, vineyards, and oliveyards,
and fruit trees in abundance: and they ate, and were filled, and became
fat, and abounded with delight in thy great goodness.</p>

<p>9:26. But they provoked thee to wrath, and departed from thee, and threw
thy law behind their backs: and they killed thy prophets, who admonished
them earnestly to return to thee: and they were guilty of great
blasphemies.</p>

<p>9:27. And thou gavest them into the hands of their enemies, and they
afflicted them. And in the time of their tribulation they cried to thee,
and thou heardest from heaven, and according to the multitude of thy
tender mercies thou gavest them saviours, to save them from the hands of
their enemies.</p>

<p>9:28. But after they had rest, they returned to do evil in thy sight:
and thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, and they had
dominion over them. Then they returned, and cried to thee: and thou
heardest from heaven, and deliveredst them many times in thy mercies.</p>

<p>9:29. And thou didst admonish them to return to thy law. But they dealt
proudly, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but sinned against thy
judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them: and they withdrew
the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</p>

<p>9:30. And thou didst forbear with them for many years, and didst testify
against them by thy spirit by the hand of thy prophets: and they heard
not, and thou didst deliver them into the hand of the people of the
lands.</p>

<p>9:31. Yet in thy very many mercies thou didst not utterly consume them,
nor forsake them: because thou art a merciful and gracious God.</p>

<p>9:32. Now therefore our God, great, strong, and terrible, who keepest
covenant and mercy, turn not away from thy face all the labour which
hath come upon us, upon our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and
our prophets, and our fathers, and all the people from the days of the
king of Assur, until this day.</p>

<p>9:33. And thou art just in all things that have come upon us: because
thou hast done truth, but we have done wickedly.</p>

<p>9:34. Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept
thy law, and have not minded thy commandments, and thy testimonies which
thou hast testified among them.</p>

<p>9:35. And they have not served thee in their kingdoms, and in thy
manifold goodness, which thou gavest them, and in the large and fat
land, which thou deliveredst before them, nor did they return from their
most wicked devices.</p>

<p>9:36. Behold we ourselves this day are bondmen: and the land, which thou
gavest our fathers, to eat the bread thereof, and the good things
thereof, and we ourselves are servants in it.</p>

<p>9:37. And the fruits thereof grow up for the kings, whom thou hast set
over us for our sins, and they have dominion over our bodies, and over
our beasts, according to their will, and we are in great tribulation.</p>

<p>9:38. And because of all this we ourselves make a covenant, and write
it, and our princes, our Levites, and our priests sign it.</p>

<p>2 Esdras Chapter 10</p>

<p>The names of the subscribers to the covenant, and the contents of it.</p>

<p>10:1. And the subscribers were Nehemias, Athersatha the son of Hachelai,
and Sedecias,</p>

<p>10:2. Saraias, Azarias, Jeremias,</p>

<p>10:3. Pheshur, Amarias, Melchias,</p>

<p>10:4. Hattus, Sebenia, Melluch,</p>

<p>10:5. Harem, Merimuth, Obdias,</p>

<p>10:6. Daniel, Genthon, Baruch,</p>

<p>10:7. Mosollam, Abia, Miamin,</p>

<p>10:8. Maazia, Belgia, Semeia: these were priests.</p>

<p>10:9. And the Levites, Josue the son of Azanias, Bennui of the sons of
Henadad, Cedmihel,</p>

<p>10:10. And their brethren, Sebenia, Oduia, Celita, Phalaia, Hanan,</p>

<p>10:11. Micha, Rohob, Hasebia,</p>

<p>10:12. Zachur, Serebia, Sabania,</p>

<p>10:13. Odaia, Bani, Baninu.</p>

<p>10:14. The heads of the people, Pharos, Phahath Moab, Elam, Zethu, Bani,</p>

<p>10:15. Bonni, Azgad, Bebai,</p>

<p>10:16. Adonia, Begoai, Adin,</p>

<p>10:17. Ater, Hezecia, Azur,</p>

<p>10:18. Odaia, Hasum, Besai,</p>

<p>10:19. Hareph, Anathoth, Nebai,</p>

<p>10:20. Megphias, Mosollam, Hazir,</p>

<p>10:21. Mesizabel, Sadoc, Jeddua,</p>

<p>10:22. Pheltia, Hanan, Anaia,</p>

<p>10:23. Osee, Hanania, Hasub,</p>

<p>10:24. Alohes, Phalea, Sobec,</p>

<p>10:25. Rehum, Hasebna, Maasia,</p>

<p>10:26. Echaia, Hanan, Anan,</p>

<p>10:27. Melluch, Haran, Baana:</p>

<p>10:28. And the rest of the people, priests, Levites, porters, and
singing men, Nathinites, and all that had separated themselves from the
people of the lands to the law of God, their wives, their sons, and
their daughters.</p>

<p>10:29. All that could understand, promising for their brethren, with
their chief men, and they came to promise, and swear that they would
walk in the law of God, which he gave in the hand of Moses the servant
of God, that they would do and keep all the commandments of the Lord our
God, and his judgments and his ceremonies.</p>

<p>10:30. And that we would not give our daughters to the people of the
land, nor take their daughters for our sons.</p>

<p>10:31. And if the people of the land bring in things to sell, or any
things for use, to sell them on the sabbath day, that we would not buy
them on the sabbath, or on the holy day. And that we would leave the
seventh year, and the exaction of every hand.</p>

<p>10:32. And we made ordinances for ourselves, to give the third part of a
sicle every year for the work of the house of our God,</p>

<p>10:33. For the loaves of proposition, and for the continual sacrifice,
and for a continual holocaust on the sabbaths, on the new moons, on the
set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offering: that
atonement might be made for Israel, and for every use of the house of
our God.</p>

<p>10:34. And we cast lots among the priests, and the Levites, and the
people for the offering of wood, that it might be brought into the house
of our God by the houses of our fathers at set times, from year to year:
to burn upon the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the law
of Moses:</p>

<p>10:35. And that we would bring the firstfruits of our land, and the
firstfruits of all fruit of every tree, from year to year, in the house
of our Lord.</p>

<p>10:36. And the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is
written in the law, and the firstlings of our oxen, and of our sheep, to
be offered in the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the
house of our God.</p>

<p>10:37. And that we would bring the firstfruits of our meats, and of our
libations, and the fruit of every tree, of the vintage also and of oil
to the priests, to the storehouse of our God, and the tithes of our
ground to the Levites. The Levites also shall receive the tithes of our
works out of all the cities.</p>

<p>10:38. And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites in the
tithes of the Levites, and the Levites shall offer the tithe of their
tithes in the house of our God, to the storeroom into the treasure
house.</p>

<p>10:39. For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall carry
to the treasury the firstfruits of corn, of wine, and of oil: and the
sanctified vessels shall be there, and the priests, and the singing men,
and the porters, and ministers, and we will not forsake the house of our
God.</p>

<p>2 Esdras Chapter 11</p>

<p>Who were the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the other cities.</p>

<p>11:1. And the princes of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: but the rest of
the people cast lots, to take one part in ten to dwell in Jerusalem the
holy city, and nine parts in the other cities.</p>

<p>11:2. And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered
themselves to dwell in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>11:3. These therefore are the chief men of the province, who dwelt in
Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda. And every one dwelt in his
possession, in their cities: Israel, the priests, the Levites, the
Nathinites, and the children of the servants of Solomon.</p>

Mosollam, the son of Joed, the son of Phadaia, the son of Colaia, the

twenty-two. And Adaia the son of Jeroham, the son of Phelelia, the son

two. And Amassai the son of Azreel, the son of Ahazi, the son of

of the house of God, of the princes of the Levites,</p>

<p>11:17. And Mathania the son of Micha, the son of Zebedei, the son of
Asaph, was the principal man to praise, and to give glory in prayer, and
Becbecia, the second, one of his brethren, and Abda the son of Samua,
the son of Galal, the son of Idithun.</p>

<p>11:18. All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred eighty-four.</p>

<p>11:19. And the porters, Accub, Telmon, and their brethren, who kept the
doors: a hundred seventy-two.</p>

<p>11:20. And the rest of Israel, the priests and the Levites were in all
the cities of Juda, every man in his possession.</p>

<p>11:21. And the Nathinites, that dwelt in Ophel, and Siaha, and Gaspha of
the Nathinites.</p>

<p>11:22. And the overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem, was Azzi the son of
Bani, the son of Hasabia, the son of Mathania, the son of Micha. Of the
sons of Asaph, were the singing men in the ministry of the house of God.</p>

<p>11:23. For the king's commandment was concerning them, and an order
among the singing men day by day.</p>

<p>11:24. And Phathahia the son of Mesezebel of the children of Zara the
son of Juda was at the hand of the king, in all matters concerning the
people,</p>

<p>11:25. And in the houses through all their countries. Of the children of
Juda some dwelt at Cariath-Arbe, and in the villages thereof: and at
Dibon, and in the villages thereof: and at Cabseel, and in the villages
thereof.</p>

<p>11:26. And at Jesue, and at Molada, and at Bethphaleth,</p>

<p>11:30. Zanoa, Odollam, and in their villages, at Lachis and its
dependencies, and at Azeca and the villages thereof. And they dwelt from
Bersabee unto the valley of Ennom.</p>

<p>11:36. And of the Levites were portions of Juda and Benjamin.</p>

<p>2 Esdras Chapter 12</p>

<p>The priests, and Levites that came up with Zorobabel. The succession of
high priests: the solemnity of the dedication of the wall.</p>

<p>12:1. Now these are the priests and the Levites, that went up with
Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Josue: Saraia, Jeremias, Esdras,</p>

<p>12:2. Amaria, Melluch, Hattus,</p>

<p>12:3. Sebenias, Rheum, Merimuth,</p>

<p>12:4. Addo, Genthon, Abia,</p>

<p>12:5. Miamin, Madia, Belga,</p>

<p>12:6. Semeia, and Joiarib, Idaia, Sellum Amoc, Helcias,</p>

<p>12:7. Idaia. These were the chief of the priests, and of their brethren
in the days of Josue.</p>

<p>12:8. And the Levites, Jesua, Bennui, Cedmihel, Sarebia, Juda,
Mathanias, they and their brethren were over the hymns:</p>

<p>12:9. And Becbecia, and Hanni, and their brethren every one in his
office.</p>

<p>12:10. And Josue begot Joacim, and Joacim begot Eliasib, and Eliasib
begot Joiada,</p>

<p>12:11. And Joiada begot Jonathan and Jonathan begot Jeddoa.</p>

<p>12:12. And in the days of Joacim the priests and heads of the families
were: Of Saraia, Maraia: of Jeremias, Hanania:</p>

<p>12:13. Of Esdras, Mosollam: and of Amaria, Johanan:</p>

<p>12:14. Of Milicho, Jonathan: of Sebenia, Joseph:</p>

<p>12:15. Of Haram, Edna: of Maraioth, Helci:</p>

<p>12:16. Of Adaia, Zacharia: of Genthon, Mosollam:</p>

<p>12:17. Of Abia, Zechri: of Miamin and Moadia, Phelti:</p>

<p>12:18. Of Belga, Sammua of Semaia, Jonathan:</p>

<p>12:19. Of Joiarib, Mathanai: of Jodaia, Azzi:</p>

<p>12:20. Of Sellai, Celai: of Amoc, Heber:</p>

<p>12:21. Of Helcias, Hasebia: of Idaia, Nathanael.</p>

<p>12:22. The Levites the chiefs of the families in the days of Eliasib,
and Joiada, and Johanan, and Jeddoa, were recorded, and the priests in
the reign of Darius the Persian.</p>

<p>12:23. The sons of Levi, heads of the families were written in the book
of Chronicles, even unto the days of Jonathan the son of Eliasib.</p>

<p>12:24. Now the chief of the Levites were Hasebia, Serebia, and Josue the
son of Cedmihel: and their brethren by their courses, to praise and to
give thanks according to the commandment of David the man of God, and to
wait equally in order.</p>

<p>12:25. Mathania, and Becbecia, Obedia, and Mosollam, Telmon, Accub, were
keepers of the gates and of the entrances before the gates.</p>

<p>12:26. These were in the days of Joacim the son of Josue, the son of
Josedec, and in the days of Nehemias the governor, and of Esdras the
priest and scribe.</p>

<p>12:27. And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the
Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, and to keep
the dedication, and to rejoice with thanksgiving, and with singing, and
with cymbals, and psalteries and harps.</p>

<p>12:28. And the sons of the singing men were gathered together out of the
plain country about Jerusalem, and out of the villages of Nethuphati,</p>

<p>12:29. And from the house of Galgal, and from the countries of Geba and
Azmaveth: for the singing men had built themselves villages round about
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>12:30. And the priests and the Levites were purified, and they purified
the people, and the gates, and the wall.</p>

<p>12:31. And I made the princes of Juda go up upon the wall, and I
appointed two great choirs to give praise. And they went on the right
hand upon the wall toward the dung gate.</p>

<p>12:32. And after them went Osaias, and half of the princes of Juda,</p>

<p>12:33. And Azarias, Esdras, and Mosollam, Judas, and Benjamin, and
Semeia, and Jeremias.</p>

<p>12:34. And of the sons of the priests with trumpets, Zacharias the son
of Jonathan, the son of Semeia, the son of Mathania, the son of Michaia,
the son of Zechur, the son of Asaph,</p>

<p>12:35. And his brethren Semeia, and Azareel, Malalai, Galalai, Maai,
Nathanael, and Judas, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David
the man of God: and Esdras the scribe before them at the fountain gate.</p>

<p>12:36. And they went up over against them by the stairs of the city of
David, at the going up of the wall of the house of David, and to the
water gate eastward:</p>

<p>12:37. And the second choir of them that gave thanks went on the
opposite side, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the
wall, and upon the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad wall,</p>

<p>12:38. And above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above
the fish gate and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Emath, and
even to the flock gate: and they stood still in the watch gate.</p>

<p>12:39. And the two choirs of them that gave praise stood still at the
house of God, and I and the half of the magistrates with me.</p>

<p>12:40. And the priests, Eliachim, Maasia, Miamin, Michea, Elioenai,
Zacharia, Hanania with trumpets,</p>

<p>12:41. And Maasia, and Semeia, and Eleazar, and Azzi, and Johanan, and
Melchia, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sung loud, and Jezraia was
their overseer:</p>

<p>12:42. And they sacrificed on that day great sacrifices, and they
rejoiced: for God had made them joyful with great joy: their wives also
and their children rejoiced, and the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar
off.</p>

<p>12:43. They appointed also in that day men over the storehouses of the
treasure, for the libations, and for the firstfruits, and for the
tithes, that the rulers of the city might bring them in by them in
honour of thanksgiving, for the priests and Levites: for Juda was joyful
in the priests and Levites that assisted.</p>

<p>12:44. And they kept the watch of their God, and the observance of
expiation, and the singing men, and the porters, according to the
commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.</p>

<p>12:45. For in the days of David and Asaph from the beginning there were
chief singers appointed, to praise with canticles, and give thanks to
God.</p>

<p>12:46. And all Israel, in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days of
Nehemias gave portions to the singing men, and to the porters, day by
day, and they sanctified the Levites, and the Levites sanctified the
sons of Aaron.</p>

<p>Sanctified... That is, they gave them that which by the law was set
aside, and sanctified for their use.</p>

<p>2 Esdras Chapter 13</p>

<p>Divers abuses are reformed.</p>

<p>13:1. And on that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of
the people: and therein was found written, that the Ammonites and the
Moabites should not come in to the church of God for ever:</p>

<p>13:2. Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water:
and they hired against them Balaam, to curse them, and our God turned
the curse into blessing.</p>

<p>13:3. And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they
separated every stranger from Israel.</p>

<p>13:4. And over this thing was Eliasib the priest, who was set over the
treasury of the house of our God, and was near akin to Tobias.</p>

<p>Over this thing, etc... Or, he was faulty in this thing, or in this
kind.</p>

<p>13:5. And he made him a great storeroom, where before him they laid up
gifts, and frankincense, and vessels, and the tithes of the corn, of the
wine, and of the oil, the portions of the Levites, and of the singing
men, and of the porters, and the firstfruits of the priests.</p>

<p>13:6. But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem, because in the two
and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I went to the king,
and after certain days I asked the king:</p>

<p>13:7. And I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the evil that Eliasib
had done for Tobias, to make him a storehouse in the courts of the house
of God.</p>

<p>13:8. And it seemed to me exceeding evil. And I cast forth the vessels
of the house of Tobias out of the storehouse.</p>

<p>13:9. And I commanded and they cleansed again the vessels of the house
of God, the sacrifice, and the frankincense.</p>

<p>13:10. And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
given them: and that the Levites, and the singing men, and they that
ministered were fled away every man to his own country:</p>

<p>13:11. And I pleaded the matter against the magistrates, and said: Why
have we forsaken the house of God? And I gathered them together, and I
made them to stand in their places.</p>

<p>13:12. And all Juda brought the tithe of the corn, and the wine, and the
oil into the storehouses.</p>

<p>13:13. And we set over the storehouses Selemias the priest, and Sadoc
the scribe, and of the Levites Phadaia, and next to them Hanan the son
of Zachur, the son of Mathania: for they were approved as faithful, and
to them were committed the portions of their brethren.</p>

<p>13:14. Remember me, O my God, for this thing, and wipe not out my
kindnesses, which I have done relating to the house of my God and his
ceremonies.</p>

<p>13:15. In those days I saw in Juda some treading the presses on the
sabbath, and carrying sheaves, and lading asses with wine, and grapes,
and figs, and all manner of burthens, and bringing them into Jerusalem
on the sabbath day. And I charged them that they should sell on a day on
which it was lawful to sell.</p>

<p>13:16. Some Tyrians also dwelt there, who brought fish, and all manner
of wares: and they sold them on the sabbaths to the children of Juda in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>13:17. And I rebuked the chief men of Juda, and said to them: What is
this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the sabbath day:</p>

<p>13:18. Did not our fathers do these things, and our God brought all this
evil upon us, and upon this city? And you bring more wrath upon Israel
by violating the sabbath.</p>

<p>13:19. And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem were at
rest on the sabbath day, I spoke: and they shut the gates, and I
commanded that they should not open them till after the sabbath: and I
set some of my servants at the gates, that none should bring in burthens
on the sabbath day.</p>

<p>13:20. So the merchants, and they that sold all kinds of wares, stayed
without Jerusalem, once or twice.</p>

<p>13:21. And I charged them, and I said to them: Why stay you before the
wall? if you do so another time, I will lay hands on you. And from that
time they came no more on the sabbath.</p>

<p>13:22. I spoke also to the Levites that they should be purified, and
should come to keep the gates, and to sanctify the sabbath day: for this
also remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the multitude of
thy tender mercies.</p>

<p>13:23. In those days also I saw Jews that married wives, women of
Azotus, and of Ammon, and of Moab.</p>

<p>13:24. And their children spoke half in the speech of Azotus, and could
not speak the Jews' language, but they spoke according to the language
of this and that people.</p>

<p>13:25. And I chid them, and laid my curse upon them. And I beat some of
them, and shaved off their hair, and made them swear by God that they
would not give their daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters
for their sons, nor for themselves, saying:</p>

<p>13:26. Did not Solomon king of Israel sin in this kind of thing: and
surely among many nations, there was not a king like him, and he was
beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: and yet women
of other countries brought even him to sin.</p>

<p>13:27. And shall we also be disobedient and do all this great evil to
transgress against our God, and marry strange women:</p>

<p>13:28. And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliasib the high priest,
was son in law to Sanaballat the Horonite, and I drove him from me.</p>

<p>13:29. Remember them, O Lord my God, that defile the priesthood, and the
law of priests and Levites.</p>

<p>13:30. So I separated from them all strangers, and I appointed the
courses of the priests and the Levites, every man in his ministry:</p>

<p>13:31. And for the offering of wood at times appointed, and for the
firstfruits: remember me, O my God, unto good. Amen.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
