<p>THE FIRST BOOK OF PARALIPOMENON</p>

<p>These Books are called by the Greek interpreters, Paralipomenon, that
is, of things left out, or omitted; because they are a kind of a
supplement of such things as were passed over in the books of the Kings.
The Hebrews call them Dibre Haijamim, that is, The words of the days, or
The Chronicles.--Not that they are the books which are so often quoted
in the Kings, under the title of the words of the days of the kings of
Israel, and of the kings of Juda: for the books of Paralipomenon were
written after the books of Kings: but because in all probability they
have been abridged from those ancient words of the days, by Esdras or
some other sacred writer.</p>

children of Juda.</p>

<p>Ram... He is commonly called Aram. But it is to be observed here, once
for all, that it was a common thing among the Hebrews for the same
persons to have different names: and that it is not impossible among so
many proper names, as here occur in the first nine chapters of this
book, that the transcribers of the ancient Hebrew copies may have made
some slips in the orthography.</p>

<p>2:11. And Nahasson begot Salma, the father of Booz.</p>

land of Galaad.</p>

<p>2:23. And he took Gessur, and Aram the towns of Jair, and Canath, and
the villages thereof, threescore cities. All these, the sons of Machir

and Molid.</p>

<p>2:30. And the sons of Nadab were Saled and Apphaim. And Saled died
without children.</p>

<p>2:31. But the son of Apphaim was Jesi: and Jesi begot Sesan. &nbsp;And Sesan
begot Oholai.</p>

<p>2:32. And the sons of Jada the brother of Semei: Jether and Jonathan.
And Jether also died without children.</p>

<p>2:33. But Jonathan begot Phaleth, and Ziza. These were the sons of
Jerameel.</p>

<p>2:34. And Sesan had no sons, but daughters and a servant an Egyptian,
named Jeraa.</p>

<p>2:35. And he gave him his daughter to wife: and she bore him Ethei.</p>

<p>2:36. And Ethei begot Nathan, and Nathan begot Zabad.</p>

<p>2:37. And Zabad begot Ophlal, and Ophlal begot Obed.</p>

Calor (Chamath) father of the house of Rechab.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 3</p>

Ezechias king of Juda: and they beat down their tents, and slew the
inhabitants that were found there, and utterly destroyed them unto this
day: and they dwelt in their place, because they found there fat
pastures.</p>

<p>4:42. Some also of the children of Simeon, five hundred men, went into

<p>5:2. But of the race of Juda, who was the strongest among his brethren,
came the princes: but the first birthright was accounted to Joseph.)</p>

and Nodab,</p>

<p>5:20. Gave them help. And the Agarites were delivered into their hands,
and all that were with them, because they called upon God in the battle:
and he heard them, because they had put their faith in him.</p>

<p>5:21. And they took all that they possessed, of camels fifty thousand,
and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand,
and of men a hundred thousand souls.</p>

<p>5:22. And many fell down slain: for it was the battle of the Lord. And
they dwelt in their stead till the captivity.</p>

<p>5:23. And the children of the half tribe of Manasses possessed the land,
from the borders of Basan unto Baal, Hermon, and Sanir, and mount
Hermon, for their number was great.</p>

Jesi, and Eliel, and Esriel, and Jeremia, and Odoia, and Jediel, most
valiant and powerful men, and famous chiefs in their families.</p>

<p>5:25. But they forsook the God of their fathers, and went astray after
the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them.</p>

<p>5:26. And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Phul king of the
Assyrians. and the spirit of Thelgathphalnasar king of Assur: and he
carried away Ruben, and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses, and brought
them to Lahela, and to Habor, and to Ara, and to the river of Gozan,
unto this day.</p>

<p>8:38. And Asel had six sons whose names were Ezricam, Bochru, Ismahel,
Saris, Obdia, and Hanan. All these were the sons of Asel.</p>

<p>8:39. And the sons of Esec, his brother, were Ulam the firstborn, and
Jehus the second, and Eliphalet the third.</p>

<p>8:40. And the sons of Ulam were most valiant men, and archers of great
strength: and they had many sons and grandsons, even to a hundred and
fifty. All these were children of Benjamin.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 9</p>

<p>The Israelites, priests, and Levites, who first dwelt in Jerusalem after
the captivity. A repetition of the genealogy of Saul.</p>

<p>9:1. And all Israel was numbered: and the sum of them was written in the
book of the kings of Israel, and Juda: and they were carried away to
Babylon for their transgression.</p>

<p>9:2. Now the first that dwelt in their possessions, and in their cities,
were the Israelites, and the priests, and the Levites, and the
Nathineans.</p>

<p>Nathineans... These were the posterity of the Gabaonites, whose office
was to bring wood, water, etc., for the service of the temple.</p>

<p>9:3. And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Juda, and of the children
of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and of Manasses.</p>

<p>9:4. Othei the son of Ammiud, the son of Amri, the son of Omrai, the son
of Bonni of the sons of Phares the son of Juda.</p>

<p>9:5. And of Siloni: Asaia the firstborn, and his sons.</p>

<p>9:6. And of the sons of Zara: Jehuel and their brethren, six hundred and
ninety.</p>

<p>9:7. And of the sons of Benjamin: Salo the son of Mosollam, the son of
Oduia, the son of Asana:</p>

<p>9:8. And Jobania the son of Jeroham: and Ela the son of Ozi, the son of
Mochori and Mosallam the son of Saphatias, the son of Rahuel, the son of
Jebania:</p>

<p>9:9. And their brethren by their families, nine hundred and fifty-six.
All these were heads of their families, by the houses of their fathers.</p>

<p>9:10. And of the priests: Jedaia, Joiarib, and Jachin:</p>

<p>9:11. And Azarias the son of Helcias, the son of Mosollam, the son of
Sadoc, the son of Maraioth, the son of Achitob, high priest of the house
of God.</p>

<p>9:12. And Adaias the son of Jeroham, the son of Phassur, the son of
Melchias, and Maasai the son of Adiel, the son of Jezra, the son of
Mosollam, the son of Mosollamith, the son of Emmer.</p>

<p>9:13. And their brethren heads in their families a thousand seven
hundred and threescore, very strong and able men for the work of the
ministry in the house of God.</p>

<p>9:14. And of the Levites: Semeia the son of Hassub the son of Ezricam,
the son of Hasebia of the sons of Merari.</p>

<p>9:15. And Bacbacar the carpenter, and Galal, and Mathania the son of
Micha, the son of Zechri the son of Asaph:</p>

<p>9:16. And Obdia the son of Semeia, the son of Galal, the son of Idithum:
and Barachia the son of Asa, the son of Elcana, who dwelt in the suburbs
of Netophati.</p>

<p>9:17. And the porters were Sellum, and Accub, and Telmon, and Ahiman:
and their brother Sellum was the prince,</p>

<p>9:18. Until that time, in the king's gate eastward, the sons of Levi
waited by their turns.</p>

<p>9:19. But Sellum the son of Core, the son of Abiasaph, the son of Core,
with his brethren and his father's house, the Corites were over the
works of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their
families in turns were keepers of the entrance of the camp of the Lord.</p>

<p>9:20. And Phinees the son of Eleazar, was their prince before the Lord,</p>

<p>9:21. And Zacharias the son of Mosollamia, was porter of the gate of the
tabernacle of the testimony:</p>

<p>9:22. All these that were chosen to be porters at the gates, were two
hundred and twelve: the they were registered in their proper towns: whom
David and Samuel the seer appointed in their trust.</p>

<p>9:23. As well them as their sons, to keep the gates of the house of the
Lord, and the tabernacle by their turns.</p>

<p>9:24. In four quarters were the porters: that is to say, toward the
east, and west, and north, and south.</p>

<p>9:25. And their brethren dwelt in village, and came upon their sabbath
days from time to time.</p>

<p>9:26. To these four Levites were committed the whole number of the
porters, and they were over the chambers, and treasures, of the house of
the Lord.</p>

<p>9:27. And they abode in their watches round about the temple of the
Lord: that when it was time, they might open the gates in the morning.</p>

<p>9:28. And some of their stock had the charge of the vessels for the
ministry: for the vessels were both brought in and carried out by
number.</p>

<p>9:29. Some of them also had the instruments of the sanctuary committed
unto them, and the charge of the fine flour, and wine, and oil, and
frankincense, and spices.</p>

<p>9:30. And the sons of the priests made the ointments of the spices.</p>

<p>9:31. And Mathathias a Levite, the firstborn of Sellum the Corite, was
overseer of such things as were fried the fryingpan.</p>

<p>9:32. And some of the sons of Caath their brethren, were over the loaves
of proposition, to prepare always new for every sabbath.</p>

<p>9:33. These are the chief of the singing men of the families of the
Levites, who dwelt in the chambers, by the temple, that they might serve
continually day and night in their ministry.</p>

<p>9:34. The heads of the Levites, princes in their families, abode in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>9:35. And in Gabaon dwelt Jehiel the father of Gabaon, and the name of
his wife was Maacha:</p>

<p>9:36. His firstborn son Abdon, and Sur, and Cis, and Baal, and Ner, and
Nadab,</p>

<p>9:37. Gedor also, and Ahio, and Zacharias, and Macelloth.</p>

<p>9:38. And Macelloth begot Samaan: these dwelt over against their
brethren in Jerusalem, with their brethren.</p>

<p>9:39. Now Ner begot Cis: and Cis begot Saul: and Saul begot Jonathan and
Melchisua, and Abinadab, and Esbaal.</p>

<p>9:40. And the son of Jonathan, was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begot Micha.</p>

<p>9:41. And the sons of Micha, were Phithon, and Melech, and Tharaa, and
Ahaz.</p>

<p>9:42. And Ahaz begot Jara, and Jara begot Alamath, and Azmoth, and
Zamri. And Zamri begot Mosa.</p>

<p>9:43. And Mosa begot Banaa: whose son Raphaia begot Elasa: of whom was
born Asel.</p>

<p>9:44. And Asel had six sons whose names are, Ezricam Bochru, Ismahel,
Saria, Obdia, Hanan: these are the sons of Asel.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 10</p>

<p>Saul is slain for his sins: he is buried by the men of Jabes.</p>

<p>10:1. Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel
fled from before the Philistines, and fell down wounded in mount Gelboe.</p>

<p>10:2. And the Philistines drew near pursuing after Saul, and his sons,
and they killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchisua the sons of Saul.</p>

<p>10:3. And the battle grew hard against Saul and the archers reached him,
and wounded him with arrows.</p>

<p>10:4. And Saul said to his armourbearer: Draw thy sword, and kill me:
lest these uncircumcised come, and mock me. But his armourbearer would
not, for he was struck with fear: so Saul took his sword, and fell upon
it.</p>

<p>10:5. And when his armourbearer saw it, to wit, that Saul was dead, he
also fell upon his sword and died.</p>

<p>10:6. So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house fell together.</p>

<p>10:7. And when the men of Israel, that dwelt in the plains, saw this,
they fled: and Saul and his sons being dead, they forsook their cities,
and were scattered up and down: and the Philistines came, and dwelt in
them.</p>

<p>10:8. And the next day the Philistines taking away the spoils of them
that were slain, found Saul and his sons lying on mount Gelboe.</p>

<p>10:9. And when they had stripped him, and out off his head, and taken
away his armour, they sent it into their land, to be carried about, and
shewn in the temples of the idols and to the people.</p>

<p>10:10. And his armour they dedicated in the temple of their god, and his
head they fastened up in the temple of Dagon.</p>

<p>10:11. And when the men of Jabes Galaad had heard this, to wit, all that
the Philistines had done to Saul,</p>

<p>10:12. All the valiant men of them arose, and took the bodies of Saul
and of his sons, and brought them to Jabes, and buried their bones under
the oak that was in Jabes, and they fasted seven days.</p>

<p>10:13. So Saul died for his iniquities, because he transgressed the
commandment of the Lord, which he had commanded, and kept it not: and
moreover consulted also a witch,</p>

<p>10:14. And trusted not in the Lord: therefore he slew him, and
transferred his kingdom to David the son of Isai.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 11</p>

<p>David is made king. He taketh the castle of Sion. A catalogue of his
valiant men.</p>

<p>11:1. Then all Israel gathered themselves to David in Hebron, saying: We
are thy bone, and thy flesh.</p>

<p>11:2. Yesterday also, and the day before when Saul was king, thou wast
he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: for the Lord thy God said
to thee: Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over
them.</p>

<p>11:3. So all the ancients of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and
David made a covenant with them before the Lord: and they anointed him
king over Israel according to the word of the Lord which he spoke in the
hand of Samuel.</p>

<p>11:4. And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus, where
the Jebusites were the inhabitants of the land.</p>

<p>11:5. And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David: Thou shalt not come in
here. But David took the castle of Sion, which is the city of David.</p>

<p>11:6. And he said: Whosoever shall first strike the Jebusites, shall be
the head and chief captain. And Joab the son of Sarvia went up first,
and was made the general.</p>

<p>11:7. And David dwelt in the castle, and therefore it was called the
city of David,</p>

<p>11:8. And he built the city round about from Mello all round, and Joab
built the rest of the city.</p>

<p>11:9. And David went on growing and increasing, and the Lord of hosts
was with him.</p>

<p>11:10. These are the chief of the valiant man of David, who helped him
to be made king over all Israel, according to the word of the Lord,
which he spoke to Israel.</p>

<p>11:11. And this is the number of the heroes of David: Jesbaam the son of
Hachamoni the chief among the thirty: he lifted up his spear against
three hundred wounded by him at one time.</p>

<p>11:12. And after him was Eleazar his uncle's son the Ahohite, who was
one of the three mighties.</p>

<p>11:13. He was with David in Phesdomim, when the Philistines were
gathered to that place to battle: and the field of that country was full
of barley, and the people fled from before the Philistines.</p>

<p>11:14. But these men stood in the midst of the field, and defended it:
and they slew the Philistines, and the Lord gave a great deliverance to
his people.</p>

<p>11:15. And three of the thirty captains went down to the rock, wherein
David was, to the cave of Odollam, when the Philistines encamped in the
valley of Raphaim.</p>

<p>11:16. And David was in a hold, and the garrison of the Philistines in
Bethlehem.</p>

<p>11:17. And David longed, and said: O that some man would give me water
of the cistern of Bethlehem, which is in the gate.</p>

<p>11:18. And these three broke through the midst of the camp of the
Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of Bethlehem, which was
in the gate, and brought it to David to drink: and he would not drink of
it, but rather offered it to the Lord,</p>

<p>11:19. Saying: God forbid that I should do this in the sight of my God,
and should drink the blood of these men: for with the danger of their
lives they have brought me the water. And therefore he would not drink.
These things did the three most valiant.</p>

<p>11:20. And Abisai the brother of Joab, he was chief of three, and he
lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew, and he was
renowned among the three,</p>

<p>11:21. And illustrious among the second three, and their captain: but
yet he attained not to the first three.</p>

<p>11:22. Banaias the son of Joiada a most valiant man, of Cabseel, who had
done many acts: he slew the two ariels of Moab: and he went down, and
killed a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow.</p>

<p>Two ariels... That is, two lions, or lion-like men; for Ariel in Hebrew
signifies a lion.</p>

<p>11:23. And he slew an Egyptian, whose stature was of five cubits, and
who had a spear like a weaver's beam: and he went down to him with a
staff, and plucked away the spear, that he held in his hand, and slew
him with his own spear.</p>

<p>11:24. These things did Banaias the son of Joiada, who was renowned
among the three valiant ones,</p>

<p>11:25. And the first among the thirty, but yet to the three he attained
not: and David made him of his council.</p>

<p>11:26. Moreover the most valiant men of the army, were Asahel brother of
Joab, and Elchanan the son of his uncle of Bethlehem,</p>

<p>11:27. Sammoth an Arorite, Helles a Phalonite,</p>

<p>11:28. Ira the son of Acces a Thecuite, Abiezer an Anathothite,</p>

<p>11:29. Sobbochai a Husathite, Ilai an Ahohite,</p>

<p>11:30. Maharai a Netophathite, Heled the son of Baana a Netophathite,</p>

<p>11:31. Ethai the son of Ribai of Gabaath of the sons of Benjamin, Banai
a Pharathonite,</p>

<p>11:32. Hurai of the torrent Gaas, Abiel an Arbathite, Azmoth a
Bauramite, Eliaba a Salabonite,</p>

<p>11:33. The sons of Assem a Gezonite, Jonathan the son of Sage an
Ararite,</p>

<p>11:34. Ahiam the son of Sachar an Ararite,</p>

<p>11:35. Eliphal the son of Ur,</p>

<p>11:36. Hepher a Mecherathite, Ahia a Phelonite,</p>

<p>11:37. Hesro a Carmelite, Naarai the son of Azbai,</p>

<p>11:38. Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibahar the son of Agarai.</p>

<p>11:39. Selec an Ammonite, Naharai a Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab
the son of Sarvia.</p>

<p>11:40. Ira a Jethrite, Gareb a Jethrite,</p>

<p>11:41. Urias a Hethite, Zabad the son of Oholi,</p>

<p>11:42. Adina the son of Siza a Rubenite the prince of the Rubenites, and
thirty with him:</p>

<p>11:43. Hanan the son of Maacha, and Josaphat a Mathanite,</p>

<p>11:44. Ozia an Astarothite, Samma, and Jehiel the sons of Hotham an
Arorite,</p>

<p>11:45. Jedihel the son of Zamri, and Joha his brother a Thosaite,</p>

<p>11:46. Eliel a Mahumite, and Jeribai, and Josaia the sons of Elnaim, and
Jethma a Moabite, Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel of Masobia.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 12</p>

<p>Who followed David when he fled from Saul. And who came to Hebron to
make him king.</p>

<p>12:1. Now these are they that came to David to Siceleg, while he yet
fled from Saul the son of Cis, and they were most valiant and excellent
warriors,</p>

<p>12:2. Bending the bow, and using either hand in hurling stones with
slings, and shooting arrows: of the brethren of Saul of Benjamin.</p>

<p>12:3. The chief was Ahiezer, and Joas, the sons of Samoa of Gabaath, and
Jaziel, and Phallet the sons of Azmoth, and Beracha, and Jehu an
Anathothite.</p>

<p>12:4. And Samaias of Gabaon, the stoutest amongst the thirty and over
the thirty; Jeremias, and Jeheziel and Johanan, and Jozabad of Gaderoth;</p>

<p>12:5. And Eluzai, and Jerimuth, and Baalia, and Samaria, and Saphatia
the Haruphite;</p>

<p>12:6. Elcana, and Jesia, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jesbaam of
Carehim:</p>

<p>12:7. And Joela, and Zabadia the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.</p>

<p>12:8. From Gaddi also there went over to David, when he lay hid in the
wilderness most valiant men, and excellent warriors, holding shield and
spear: whose faces were like the faces of a lion, and they were swift
like the roebucks on the mountains.</p>

<p>12:9. Ezer the chief, Obdias the second, Eliab the third,</p>

<p>12:10. Masmana the fourth, Jeremias the fifth,</p>

<p>12:11. Ethi the sixth, Eliel the seventh,</p>

<p>12:12. Johanan the eighth, Elzebad the ninth,</p>

<p>12:13. Jerenias the tenth, Machbani the eleventh,</p>

<p>12:14. These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the army: the least of
them was captain over a hundred soldiers, and the greatest over a
thousand.</p>

<p>12:15. These are they who passed over the Jordan in the first month,
when it is used to flow over its banks: and they put to flight all that
dwelt in the valleys both toward the east and toward the west.</p>

<p>12:16. And there came also of the men of Benjamin, and of Juda to the
hold, in which David abode.</p>

<p>12:17. And David went out to meet them, and said: If you are come
peaceably to me to help me, let my heart be joined to you: but if you
plot against me for my enemies whereas I have no iniquity in my hands,
let the God of our fathers see, and judge.</p>

<p>12:18. But the spirit came upon Amasai the chief among thirty, and he
said: We are thine, O David, and for thee, O son of Isai: peace, peace
be to thee, and peace to thy helpers. For thy God helpeth thee. So David
received them, and made them captains of the band.</p>

<p>12:19. And there were some of Manasses that went over to David, when he
came with the Philistines against Saul to fight: but he did not fight
with them: because the lords of the Philistines taking counsel sent him
back, saying: With the danger of our heads he will return to his master
Saul.</p>

<p>12:20. So when he went back to Siceleg, there fled to him of Manasses,
Ednas and Jozabad, and Jedihel, and Michael, and Ednas, and Jozabad, and
Eliu, and Salathi, captains of thousands in Manasses.</p>

<p>12:21. These helped David against the rovers: for they were all most
valiant men, and were made commanders in the army.</p>

<p>12:22. Moreover day by day there came some to David to help him till
they became a great number, like the army of God.</p>

<p>12:23. And this is the number of the chiefs of the army who came to
David, when he was in Hebron, to transfer to him the kingdom of Saul,
according to the word of the Lord.</p>

<p>12:24. The sons of Juda bearing shield and spear, six thousand eight
hundred well appointed to war.</p>

<p>12:25. Of the sons of Simeon valiant men for war, seven thousand one
hundred.</p>

<p>12:26. Of the sons of Levi, four thousand six hundred.</p>

<p>12:27. And Joiada prince of the race of Aaron, and with him three
thousand seven hundred.</p>

<p>12:28. Sadoc also a young man of excellent disposition, and the house of
his father, twenty-two principal men.</p>

<p>12:29. And of the sons of Benjamin the brethren of Saul, three thousand:
for hitherto a great part of them followed the house of Saul.</p>

<p>12:30. And of the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, men of
great valour renowned in their kindreds.</p>

<p>12:31. And of the half tribe of Manasses, eighteen thousand, every one
by their names, came to make David king.</p>

<p>12:32. Also of the sons of Issachar men of understanding, that knew all
times to order what Israel should do, two hundred principal men: and all
the rest of the tribe followed their counsel.</p>

<p>12:33. And of Zabulon such as went forth to battle, and stood in array
well appointed with armour for war, there came fifty thousand to his
aid, with no double heart.</p>

<p>12:34. And of Nephtali, a thousand leaders: and with them seven and
thirty thousand, furnished with shield and spear.</p>

<p>12:35. Of Dan also twenty-eight thousand six hundred prepared for
battle.</p>

<p>12:36. And of Aser forty thousand going forth to fight, and challenging
in battle.</p>

<p>12:37. And on the other side of the Jordan of the sons of Ruben, and of
Gad, and of the half of the tribe of Manasses a hundred and twenty
thousand, furnished with arms for war.</p>

<p>12:38. All these men of war well appointed to fight, came with a perfect
heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest
also of Israel, were of one heart to make David king.</p>

<p>12:39. And they were there with David three days eating and drinking:
for their brethren had prepared for them.</p>

<p>12:40. Moreover they that were near them even as far as Issachar, and
Zabulon, and Nephtali, brought loaves on asses, and on camels, and on
mules, and on oxen, to eat: meal, figs, raisins, wine, oil, and oxen,
and sheep in abundance, for there was joy in Israel.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 13</p>

<p>The ark is brought from Cariathiarim. Oza for touching it is struck
dead.</p>

<p>13:1. David consulted with the captains of thousands, and of hundreds,
and with all the commanders.</p>

<p>13:2. And he said to all the assembly of Israel: If it please you; and
if the words which I speak come from the Lord our God, let us send to
the rest of our brethren into all the countries of Israel, and to the
priests, and the Levites, that dwell in the suburbs of the cities, to
gather themselves to us,</p>

<p>13:3. And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we sought it
not in the days of Saul.</p>

<p>13:4. And all the multitude answered that it should be so: for the word
pleased all the people.</p>

<p>13:5. So David assembled all Israel from Sihor of Egypt, even to the
entering into Emath, to bring the ark of God from Cariathiarim.</p>

<p>13:6. And David went up with all the men of Israel to the hill of
Cariathiarim which is in Juda, to bring thence the ark of the Lord God
sitting upon the cherubims, where his name is called upon.</p>

<p>13:7. And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart out of the house
of Abinadab. And Oza and his brother drove the cart.</p>

<p>13:8. And David and all Israel played before God with all their might
with hymns, and with harps, and with psalteries, and timbrels, and
cymbals, and trumpets,</p>

<p>13:9. And when they came to the floor of Chidon, Oza put forth his hand,
to hold up the ark: for the ox being wanton had made it lean a little on
one side.</p>

<p>13:10. And the Lord was angry with Oza, and struck him, because he had
touched the ark; and he died there before the Lord.</p>

<p>13:11. And David was troubled because the Lord had divided Oza: and he
called that place the Breach of Oza to this day.</p>

<p>13:12. And he feared God at that time, saying: How can I bring in the
ark of God to me?</p>

<p>13:13. And therefore he brought it not home to himself, that is, into
the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the
Gethite.</p>

<p>13:14. And the ark of God remained in the house of Obededom three
months: and the Lord blessed his house, and all that he had.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 14</p>

<p>David's house, and children: his victories over the Philistines.</p>

<p>14:1. And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,
and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.</p>

<p>14:2. And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over
Israel, and that his kingdom was exalted over his people Israel.</p>

<p>14:3. And David took other wives in Jerusalem: and he begot sons, and
daughters.</p>

<p>14:4. Now these are the names of them that were born to him in
Jerusalem: Samua, and Sobad, Nathan, and Solomon,</p>

<p>14:5. Jebahar, and Elisua, and Eliphalet,</p>

<p>14:6. And Noga, and Napheg, and Japhia,</p>

<p>14:7. Elisama, and Baaliada, and Eliphalet.</p>

<p>14:8. And the Philistines hearing that David was anointed king over all
Israel, went all up to seek him: and David heard of it, and went out
against them.</p>

<p>14:9. And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the vale of
Raphaim.</p>

<p>14:10. And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go up against the
Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said
to him: Go up, and I will deliver them into thy hand.</p>

<p>14:11. And when they were come to Baalpharasim, David defeated them
there, and he said: God hath divided my enemies by my hand, as waters
are divided: and therefore the name of that place was called
Baalpharasim.</p>

<p>14:12. And they left there their gods, and David commanded that they
should be burnt.</p>

<p>14:13. Another time also the Philistines made an irruption, and spread
themselves abroad in the valley.</p>

<p>14:14. And David consulted God again, and God said to him: Go not up
after them, turn away from them, and come upon them over against the
pear trees.</p>

<p>14:15. And when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in the tops of
the pear trees, then shalt thou go out to battle. For God is gone out
before thee to strike the army of the Philistines.</p>

<p>14:16. And David did as God had commanded him, and defeated the army of
the Philistines, slaying them from Gabaon to Gazera.</p>

<p>14:17. And the name of David became famous in all countries, and the
Lord made all nations fear aim.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 15</p>

<p>The ark is brought into the city of David, with great solemnity. &nbsp;Michol
derideth David's devotion.</p>

<p>15:1. He made also houses for himself in the city of David: and built a
place for the ark of God, and pitched a tabernacle for it.</p>

<p>15:2. Then David said: No one ought to carry the ark of God, but the
Levites, whom the Lord hath chosen to carry it, and to minister unto
himself for ever.</p>

<p>15:3. And he gathered all Israel together into Jerusalem, that the ark
of God might be brought into its place, which he had prepared for it.</p>

<p>15:4. And the sons of Aaron also, and the Levites.</p>

<p>15:5. Of the children of Caath, Uriel was the chief, and his brethren a
hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>15:6. Of the sons of Merari, Asaia the chief, and his brethren two
hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>15:7. Of the sons of Gersom, Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred
and thirty.</p>

<p>15:8. Of the sons of Elisaphan, Semeias the chief: and his brethren two
hundred.</p>

<p>15:9. Of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief: and his brethren eighty.</p>

<p>15:10. Of the sons of Oziel, Aminadab the chief: and his brethren a
hundred and twelve.</p>

<p>15:11. And David called Sadoc, and Abiathar the priests, and the
Levites, Uriel, Asaia, Joel, Semeia, Eliel, and Aminadab:</p>

<p>15:12. And he said to them: You that are the heads of the Levitical
families, be sanctified with your brethren, and bring the ark of the
Lord the God of Israel to the place, which is prepared for it:</p>

<p>15:13. Lest as the Lord at first struck us, because you were not
present, the same should now also come to pass, by our doing some thing
against the law.</p>

<p>15:14. So the priests and the Levites were sanctified, to carry the ark
of the Lord the God of Israel.</p>

<p>15:15. And the sons of Levi took the ark of God as Moses had commanded,
according to the word of the Lord, upon their shoulders, with the
staves.</p>

<p>15:16. And David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites, to appoint some of
their brethren to be singers with musical instruments, to wit, on
psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, that the joyful noise might resound
on high.</p>

<p>15:17. And they appointed Levites, Hemam the son of Joel, and of his
brethren Asaph the son of Barachias: and of the sons of Merari, their
brethren: Ethan the son of Casaia.</p>

<p>15:18. And with them their brethren: in the second rank, Zacharias, and
Ben, and Jaziel, and Semiramoth, and Jahiel, and Ani, and Eliab, and
Banaias, and Maasias, and Mathathias, and Eliphalu, and Macenias, and
Obededom, and Jehiel, the porters.</p>

<p>15:19. Now the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, sounded with cymbals of
brass.</p>

<p>15:20. And Zacharias, and Oziel, and Semiramoth, and Jehiel, and Ani,
and Eliab, and Maasias, and Banaias, sung mysteries upon psalteries.</p>

<p>15:21. And Mathathias, and Eliphalu, and Macenias and Obededom, and
Jehiel and Ozaziu, sung a song of victory for the octave upon harps.</p>

<p>15:22. And Chonenias chief of the Levites, presided over the prophecy,
to give out the tunes: for he was very skilful.</p>

<p>The prophecy, to give out the tunes... Singing praises to God is here
called prophecy: the more, because these singers were often inspired
men.</p>

<p>15:23. And Barachias, and Elcana, were doorkeepers of the ark.</p>

<p>15:24. And Sebenias, and Josaphat, and Nathanael, and Amasai, and
Zacharias, and Banaias, and Eliezer the priests, sounded with trumpets,
before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehias were porters of the ark.</p>

<p>15:25. So David and all the ancients of Israel, and the captains over
thousands, went to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the
house of Obededom with joy.</p>

<p>15:26. And when God had helped the Levites who carried the ark of the
covenant of the Lord, they offered in sacrifice seven oxen, and seven
rams.</p>

<p>15:27. And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the
Levites that carried the ark, and the singing men, and Chonenias the
ruler of the prophecy among the singers: and David also had on him an
ephod of linen.</p>

<p>15:28. And all Israel brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord with
joyful shouting, and sounding with the sound of the cornet, and with
trumpets, and cymbals, and psalteries, and harps.</p>

<p>15:29. And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord was come to the city
of David, Michol the daughter of Saul looking out at a window, saw king
David dancing and playing, and she despised him in her heart.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 16</p>

<p>The ark is placed in the tabernacle. Sacrifice is offered. David
blesseth the people, disposeth the offices of Levites, and maketh a
psalm of praise to God.</p>

<p>16:1. So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the
tent, which David had pitched for it: and they offered holocausts, and
peace offerings before God.</p>

<p>16:2. And when David had made an end of offering holocausts, and peace
offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>16:3. And he divided to all and every one, both men and women, a loaf of
bread, and a piece of roasted beef, and flour fried with oil.</p>

<p>16:4. And he appointed Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord,
and to remember his works, and to glorify, and praise the Lord God of
Israel.</p>

<p>16:5. Asaph the chief, and next after him Zacharias: moreover Jahiel,
and Semiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mathathias, and Eliab, and Banaias, and
Obededom: and Jehiel over the instruments of psaltery, and harps: and
Asaph sounded with cymbals:</p>

<p>16:6. But Banaias, and Jaziel the priests, to sound the trumpet
continually before the ark of the covenant of the Lord.</p>

<p>16:7. In that day David made Asaph the chief to give praise to the Lord
with his brethren.</p>

<p>16:8. Praise ye the Lord, and call upon his name: make known his doings
among the nations.</p>

<p>16:9. Sing to him, yea, sing praises to him: and relate all his wondrous
works.</p>

<p>16:10. Praise ye his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice, that seek
the Lord.</p>

<p>16:11. Seek ye the Lord, and his power: seek ye his face evermore.</p>

<p>16:12. Remember his wonderful works, which he hath done: his signs, and
the judgments of his mouth.</p>

<p>16:13. O ye seed of Israel his servants, ye children of Jacob his
chosen.</p>

<p>16:14. He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</p>

<p>16:15. Remember for ever his covenant: the word, which he commanded to a
thousand generations.</p>

<p>16:16. The covenant which he made with Abraham: and his oath to Isaac.</p>

<p>16:17. And he appointed the same to Jacob for a precept: and to Israel
for an everlasting covenant:</p>

<p>16:18. Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan: the lot of your
inheritance.</p>

<p>16:19. When they were but a small number: very few and sojourners in it.</p>

<p>16:20. And they passed from nation to nation: and from a kingdom to
another people.</p>

<p>16:21. He suffered no man to do them wrong: and reproved kings for their
sake.</p>

<p>16:22. Touch not my anointed: and do no evil to my prophets.</p>

<p>16:23. Sing ye to the Lord, all the earth: shew forth from day to day
his salvation.</p>

<p>16:24. Declare his glory among the Gentiles: his wonders among all
people.</p>

<p>16:25. For the Lord is great and exceedingly to be praised: and he is to
be feared above all gods.</p>

<p>16:26. For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the
heavens.</p>

<p>16:27. Praise and magnificence are before him: strength and joy in his
place.</p>

<p>16:28. Bring ye to the Lord, O ye families of the nations: bring ye to
the Lord glory and empire.</p>

<p>16:29. Give to the Lord glory to his name, bring up sacrifice, and come
ye in his sight: and adore the Lord in holy becomingness.</p>

<p>16:30. Let all the earth be moved at his presence: for he hath founded
the world immoveable.</p>

<p>16:31. Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth be glad: and let them say
among the nations: The Lord hath reigned.</p>

<p>16:32. Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields
rejoice, and all things that are in them.</p>

<p>16:33. Then shall the trees of the wood give praise before the Lord:
because he is come to judge the earth.</p>

<p>16:34. Give ye glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth
for ever.</p>

<p>16:35. And say ye: Save us, O God our savior: and gather us together,
and deliver us from the nations, that we may give glory to thy holy
name, and may rejoice in singing thy praises.</p>

<p>16:36. Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity:
and let all the people say Amen, and a hymn to God.</p>

<p>16:37. So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
Asaph and his brethren to minister in the presence of the ark
continually day by day, and in their courses.</p>

<p>16:38. And Obededom, with his brethren sixty-eight: and Obededom the son
of Idithun, and Hosa he appointed to be porters.</p>

<p>16:39. And Sadoc the priest, and his brethren priests, before the
tabernacle of the Lord in the high place, which was in Gabaon.</p>

<p>16:40. That they should offer holocausts to the Lord upon the altar of
holocausts continually, morning and evening, according to all that is
written in the law of the Lord, which he commanded Israel.</p>

<p>16:41. And after him Heman, and Idithun, and the rest that were chosen,
every one by his name to give praise to the Lord: because his mercy
endureth for ever.</p>

<p>16:42. And Heman and Idithun sounded the trumpet, and played on the
cymbals, and all kinds of musical instruments to sing praises to God:
and the sons of Idithun he made porters.</p>

<p>16:43. And all the people returned to their houses: and David to bless
also his own house.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 17</p>

<p>David's purpose to build a temple, is rewarded by most ample promises:
David's thanksgiving.</p>

<p>17:1. Now when David was dwelling in his house, he said to Nathan the
prophet: Behold I dwell in a house of cedar: and the ark of the covenant
of the Lord is under skins.</p>

<p>17:2. And Nathan said to David: Do all that is in thy heart: for God is
with thee.</p>

<p>17:3. Now that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:</p>

<p>17:4. Go, and speak to David my servant: Thus saith the Lord: Thou shalt
not build me a house to dwell in.</p>

<p>17:5. For I have not remained in a house from the time that I brought up
Israel, to this day: but I have been always changing places in a
tabernacle, and in a tent,</p>

<p>17:6. Abiding with all Israel. Did I ever speak to any one, of all the
judges of Israel whom I charged to feed my people, saying: Why have you
not built me a house of cedar?</p>

<p>17:7. Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David: Thus saith
the Lord of hosts: I took thee from the pastures, from following the
flock, that thou shouldst be ruler of my people Israel.</p>

<p>17:8. And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone: and have
slain all thy enemies before thee, and have made thee a name like that
of one of the great ones that are renowned in the earth.</p>

<p>17:9. And I have given a place my people Israel: they shall be planted,
and shall dwell therein, and shall be moved no more, neither shall the
children of iniquity waste them, as at the beginning,</p>

<p>17:10. Since the days that I gave judges to my people Israel, and have
humbled all thy enemies. And I declare to thee, that the Lord will build
thee a house.</p>

<p>17:11. And when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy fathers, I
will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons: and I
will establish his kingdom.</p>

<p>17:12. He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for
ever.</p>

<p>17:13. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and I
will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was
before thee.</p>

<p>17:14. But I will settle him in my house, and in my kingdom for ever:
and his throne shall be most firm for ever.</p>

<p>17:15. According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
so did Nathan speak to David.</p>

<p>17:16. And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said: Who am I,
O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou shouldst give such things to
me?</p>

<p>17:17. But even this hath seemed little in thy sight, and therefore thou
hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for the time to
come: and hast made me remarkable above all men, O Lord God.</p>

<p>17:18. What can David add more, seeing thou hast thus glorified thy
servant, and known him?</p>

<p>17:19. O Lord, for thy servant's sake, according to thy own heart, thou
hast shewn all this magnificence, and wouldst have all the great things
to be known.</p>

<p>17:20. O Lord there is none like thee: and here is no other God beside
thee, of all whom we have heard of with our ears.</p>

<p>17:21. For what other nation is there upon earth like thy people Israel,
whom God went to deliver, and make a people for himself, and by his
greatness and terrors cast out nations before their face whom he had
delivered out of Egypt?</p>

<p>17:22. And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy own people for
ever, and thou, O Lord, art become their God.</p>

<p>17:23. Now therefore, O Lord, let the word which thou hast spoken to thy
servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as
thou hast said.</p>

<p>17:24. And let thy name remain and be magnified for ever: and let it be
said: The Lord of hosts is God of Israel, and the house of David his
servant remaineth before him.</p>

<p>17:25. For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant,
that thou wilt build him a house: and therefore thy servant hath found
confidence to pray before thee.</p>

<p>17:26. And now O Lord, thou art God: and thou hast promised to thy
servant such great benefits.</p>

<p>17:27. And thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, that it
may be always before thee: for seeing thou blessest it, O Lord, it shall
be blessed for ever.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 18</p>

<p>David's victories. His chief officers.</p>

<p>18:1. And it came to pass after this, that David defeated the
Philistines, and humbled them, and took away Geth, and her daughters out
of the hands of the Philistines,</p>

<p>18:2. And he defeated Moab, and the Moabites were made David's servants,
and brought him gifts.</p>

<p>18:3. At that time David defeated also Adarezer king of Soba of the land
of Hemath, when he went to extend his dominions as far as the river
Euphrates.</p>

<p>18:4. And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand
horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and he houghed all the chariot
horses, only a hundred chariots, which he reserved for himself.</p>

<p>18:5. And the Syrians of Damascus came also to help Adarezer king of
Soba: and David slew of them likewise two and twenty thousand men.</p>

<p>18:6. And he put a garrison in Damascus, that Syria also should serve
him, and bring gifts. And the Lord assisted him in all things to which
he went.</p>

<p>18:7. And David took the golden quivers which the servants of Adarezer
had, and he brought them to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>18:8. Likewise out of Thebath and Chun, cities of Adarezer, he brought
very much brass, of which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars,
and the vessels of brass.</p>

<p>18:9. Now when Thou king of Hemath heard that David had defeated all the
army of Adarezer king of Soba,</p>

<p>18:10. He sent Adoram his son to king David to desire peace of him, and
to congratulate him that he had defeated and overthrown Adarezer: for
Thou was an enemy to Adarezer.</p>

<p>18:11. And all the vessels of gold, and silver and brass king David
consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and gold which he had taken
from all the nations, as well from Edom, and from Moab, and from the
sons of Ammon, as from the Philistines, and from Amalec.</p>

<p>18:12. And Abisai the son of Sarvia slew of the Edomites in the vale of
the saltpits, eighteen thousand:</p>

<p>18:13. And he put a garrison in Edom, that Edom should serve David: and
the Lord preserved David in all things to which he went.</p>

<p>18:14. So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and
justice among all his people.</p>

<p>18:15. And Joab the son of Sarvia was over the army, and Josaphat the
son of Ahilud recorder.</p>

<p>18:16. And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and Achimelech the son of Abiathar,
were the priests: and Susa, scribe.</p>

<p>18:17. And Banaias the son of Joiada was over the bands of the Cerethi,
and the Phelethi: and the sons of David were chief about the king.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 19</p>

<p>The Ammonites abuse David's ambassadors: both they and their
confederates are overthrown.</p>

<p>19:1. Now it came to pass that Naas the king of the children of Ammon
died, and his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>19:2. And David said: I will shew kindness to Hanon the son of Naas: for
his father did a favour tome. And David sent messengers to comfort him
upon the death of his father. But when they were come into the land of
the children of Ammon, to comfort Hanon,</p>

<p>19:3. The princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon: Thou thinkest
perhaps that David to do honour to thy father hath sent comforters to
thee: and thou dost not take notice, that his servants are come to thee
to consider, and search, and spy out thy land.</p>

<p>19:4. Wherefore Hanon shaved the heads and beards of the servants of
David, and cut away their garments from the buttocks to the feet, and
sent them away.</p>

<p>19:5. And when they were gone, they sent word to David, who sent to meet
them (for they had suffered a great affront) and ordered them to stay at
Jericho till their beards grew and then to return.</p>

<p>19:6. And when the children of Ammon saw that they had done an injury to
David, Hanon and the rest of the people sent a thousand talents of
silver, to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia and out of
Syria Maacha, and out of Soba.</p>

<p>19:7. And they hired two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of
Maacha, with his people. And they came and camped over against Medaba.
And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together out of their
cities, and came to battle.</p>

<p>19:8. And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of
valiant men:</p>

<p>19:9. And the children of Ammon came out and put their army in array
before the gate of the city: and the kings, that were come to their aid,
stood apart in the field.</p>

<p>19:10. Wherefore Joab understanding that the battle was set against him
before and behind, chose out the bravest men of all Israel, and marched
against the Syrians,</p>

<p>19:11. And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abisai
his brother, and they went against the children of Ammon.</p>

<p>19:12. And he said: If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt
help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, I will
help thee.</p>

<p>19:13. Be of good courage and let us behave ourselves manfully for our
people, and for the cities of our God: and the Lord will do that which
is good in his sight.</p>

<p>19:14. So Joab and the people that were with him, went against the
Syrians to the battle: and he put them to flight.</p>

<p>19:15. And the children of Ammon seeing that the Syrians were fled, they
likewise fled from Abisai his brother, and went into the city: and Joab
also returned to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>19:16. But the Syrians seeing that they had fallen before Israel, sent
messengers, and brought to them the Syrians that were beyond the river:
and Sophach, general of the army of Adarezer, was their leader.</p>

<p>19:17. And it was told David, and he gathered together all Israel, and
passed the Jordan, and came upon them, and put his army in array against
them, and they fought with him.</p>

<p>19:18. But the Syrian fled before Israel: and David slew of the Syrians
seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and Sophach the
general of the army.</p>

<p>Seven thousand chariots... That is, of men who fought in chariots.</p>

<p>19:19. And when the servants of Adarezer saw themselves overcome by
Israel, they went over to David, and served him: and Syria would not
help the children of Ammon any more.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 20</p>

<p>Rabba is taken. Other victories over the Philistines.</p>

<p>20:1. And it came to pass after the course of a year, at the time that
kings go out to battle, Joab gathered together an army and the strength
of the troops, and wasted the land of the children of Ammon: and went
and besieged Rabba. But David stayed at Jerusalem, when Joab smote
Rabba, and destroyed it.</p>

<p>20:2. And David took the crown of Melchom from his head, and found in it
a talent weight of gold, and most precious stones, and he made himself a
diadem of it: he took also the spoils of the city which were very great.</p>

<p>20:3. And the people that were therein he brought out: and made harrows,
and sleds, and chariots of iron to go over them, so that they were cut
and bruised to pieces: in this manner David dealt with all the cities of
the children of Ammon: and he returned with all his people to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>20:4. After this there arose a war at Gazer against the Philistines: in
which Sabachai the Husathite slew Saphai of the race of Raphaim, and
humbled them.</p>

<p>20:5. Another battle also was fought against the Philistines, in which
Adeodatus the son of Saltus a Bethlehemite slew the brother of Goliath
the Gethite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</p>

<p>20:6. There was another battle also in Geth, in which there was a man of
great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each
hand and foot: who also was born of the stock of Rapha.</p>

<p>20:7. He reviled Israel: but Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of
David slew him. These were the sons of Rapha in Geth, who fell by the
hand of David and his servants.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 21</p>

<p>David's sin in numbering the people is punished by a pestilence: which
ceaseth upon his offering sacrifice in the thrashingfloor of Ornan.</p>

<p>21:1. And Satan rose up against Israel: and moved David to number
Israel.</p>

<p>21:2. And David said to Joab, and to the rulers of the people: Go, and
number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, and bring me the number of them
that I may know it.</p>

<p>21:3. And Joab answered: The Lord make his people a hundred times more
than they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all thy servants: why
doth my lord seek this thing, which may be imputed as a sin to Israel?</p>

<p>21:4. But the king's word rather prevailed: and Joab departed, and went
through all Israel: and returned to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>21:5. And he gave David the number of them, whom he had surveyed: and
all the number of Israel was found to be eleven hundred thousand men
that drew the sword: and of Juda four hundred and seventy thousand
fighting men.</p>

<p>The number, etc... The difference of the numbers here and 2 Kings 24. is
to be accounted for, by supposing the greater number to be that which
was really found, and the lesser to be that which Joab gave in.</p>

<p>21:6. But Levi and Benjamin he did not number: for Joab unwillingly
executed the king's orders.</p>

<p>21:7. And God was displeased with this thing that was commanded: and he
struck Israel.</p>

<p>21:8. And David said to God: I have sinned exceedingly in doing this: I
beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done
foolishly.</p>

<p>21:9. And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer of David, saying:</p>

<p>21:10. Go, and speak to David, and tell him: Thus saith the Lord: I give
thee the choice of three things: choose one which thou wilt, and I will
do it to thee.</p>

<p>21:11. And when Gad was come to David, he said to him: Thus saith the
Lord: choose which thou wilt:</p>

<p>21:12. Either three years famine: or three months to flee from thy
enemies, and not to be able to escape their sword: or three days to have
the sword of the Lord, and pestilence in the land, and the angel of the
Lord destroying in all the coasts of Israel: now therefore see what I
shall answer him who sent me.</p>

<p>Three years famine... Which joined with the three foregoing years of
famine mentioned, 2 Kings 21. and the seventh year of the land's
resting, would make up the seven years proposed by the prophet, 2 Kings
24.13.</p>

<p>21:13. And David said to Gad: I am on every side in a great strait: but
it is better for me to fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies
are many, than into the hands of men.</p>

<p>21:14. So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel. And there fell of
Israel seventy thousand men.</p>

<p>21:15. And he sent an angel to Jerusalem, to strike it: and as he was
striking it, the Lord beheld, and took pity for the greatness of the
evil: and said to the angel that destroyed: It is enough, now stop thy
hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the thrashingfloor of Ornan the
Jebusite.</p>

<p>Ornan... Otherwise Areuna.</p>

<p>21:16. And David lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord standing
between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand, turned against
Jerusalem: and both he and the ancients clothed in haircloth, fell down
flat on the ground.</p>

<p>21:17. And David said to God: Am not I he that commanded the people to
be numbered? It is I that have sinned: it is I that have done the evil:
but as for this flock, what hath it deserved? O Lord my God, let thy
hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon my father's house: and
let not thy people be destroyed.</p>

<p>21:18. And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David, to go up,
and build an altar to the Lord God in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the
Jebusite.</p>

<p>21:19. And David went up, according to the word of Gad, which he spoke
to him in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>21:20. Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the angel, he and his four sons
hid themselves: for at that time he was thrashing wheat in the floor.</p>

<p>21:21. And as David was coming to Ornan, Ornan saw him, and went out of
the thrashingfloor to meet him, and bowed down to him with his face to
the ground.</p>

<p>21:22. And David said to him: Give me this place of thy thrashingfloor,
that I may build therein an altar to the Lord: but thou shalt take of me
as much money as it is worth, that the plague may cease from the people.</p>

<p>21:23. And Ornan said to David: Take it, and let my lord the king do all
that pleaseth him: and moreover the oxen also I give for a holocaust,
and the drays for wood, and the wheat for the sacrifice: I will give it
all willingly.</p>

<p>21:24. And king David said to him: It shall not be so, but I will give
thee money as much as it is worth: for I must not take it from thee, and
so offer to the Lord holocausts free cost.</p>

<p>21:25. So David gave to Ornan for the place, six hundred sicles of gold
of just weight.</p>

<p>Six hundred sicles, etc... This was the price of the whole place, on
which the temple was afterwards built; but the price of the oxen was
fifty sicles of silver. 2 Kings 24.24.</p>

<p>21:26. And he built there an altar to the Lord: and he offered
holocausts, and peace offerings, and he called upon the Lord, and he
heard him by sending fire from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust.</p>

<p>21:27. And the Lord commanded the angel: and he put up his sword again
into the sheath.</p>

<p>21:28. And David seeing that the Lord had heard him in the
thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, forthwith offered victims there.</p>

<p>21:29. But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the desert,
and the altar of holocausts, was at that time in the high place of
Gabaon.</p>

<p>21:30. And David could not go to the altar there to pray to God: for he
was seized with an exceeding great fear, seeing the sword of the angel
of the Lord.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 22</p>

<p>David having prepared all necessaries, chargeth Solomon to build the
temple and the princes to assist him.</p>

<p>22:1. Then David said: This is the house of God, And this is the altar
for the holocaust of Israel.</p>

<p>22:2. And he commanded to gather together all the proselytes of the land
of Israel, and out of them he appointed stonecutters to hew stones and
polish them, to build the house of God.</p>

<p>22:3. And David prepared in abundance iron for the nails of the gates,
and for the closures and joinings: and of brass an immense weight.</p>

<p>22:4. And the cedar trees were without number, which the Sidonians, and
Tyrians brought to David.</p>

<p>22:5. And David said: Solomon my son is very young and tender, and the
house which I would have to be built to the Lord, must be such as to be
renowned in all countries: therefore I will prepare him necessaries. And
therefore before his death he prepared all the charges.</p>

<p>22:6. And he called for Solomon his son: and commanded him to build a
house to the Lord the God of Israel.</p>

<p>22:7. And David said to Solomon: My son, it was my desire to have built
a house to the name of the Lord my God.</p>

<p>22:8. But the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Thou hast shed much
blood, and fought many battles, so thou cannot not build house to my
name, after shedding so much blood before me:</p>

<p>22:9. The son, that shall be born to thee, shall be a most quiet man:
for I will make him rest from all his enemies round about: and therefore
he shall be called Peaceable: and I will give peace and quietness to
Israel all his days.</p>

<p>22:10. He shall build a house to my name, and he shall be a son to me,
and I will be a father to him: and I will establish the throne of his
kingdom over Israel for ever.</p>

<p>22:11. Now then, my son, the Lord be with thee, and do thou prosper, and
build the house to the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken of thee.</p>

<p>22:12. The Lord also give thee wisdom and understanding, that thou
mayest be able to rule Israel, and to keep the law of the Lord thy God.</p>

<p>22:13. For then thou shalt be able to prosper, if thou keep the
commandments, and judgments, which the Lord commanded Moses to teach
Israel: take courage and act manfully, fear not, nor be dismayed.</p>

<p>22:14. Behold I in my poverty have prepared the charges of the house of
the Lord, of gold a hundred thousand talents, and of silver a million of
talents: but of brass, and of iron there is no weight, for the abundance
surpasseth all account: timber also and stones I have prepared for all
the charges.</p>

<p>22:15. Thou hast also workmen in abundance, hewers of stones, and
masons, and carpenters, and of all trades the most skilful in their
work,</p>

<p>22:16. In gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, whereof there
is no number. Arise then, and be doing, and the Lord will be with thee.</p>

<p>22:17. David also charged all the princes of Israel, to help Solomon his
son,</p>

<p>22:18. Saying: You see, that the Lord your God is with you, and hath
given you rest round about, and hath delivered all your enemies into
your hands, and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his
people.</p>

<p>22:19. Give therefore your hearts and your souls, to seek the Lord your
God and arise, and build a sanctuary to the Lord God, that the ark of
the covenant of the Lord, and the vessels consecrated to the Lord, may
be brought into the house, which is built to the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 23</p>

<p>David appointeth Solomon king. The distribution of the Levites and their
offices.</p>

<p>23:1. David being old and full of days, made Solomon his son king over
Israel.</p>

<p>23:2. And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, and the
priests and Levites.</p>

<p>23:3. And the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years, and
upwards: and there were found of them thirty-eight thousand men.</p>

<p>23:4. Of these twenty-four thousand were chosen, and distributed unto
the ministry of the house of the Lord: and six thousand were the
overseers and judges.</p>

<p>23:5. Moreover four thousand were porters: and as many singers singing
to the Lord with the instruments, which he had made to sing with.</p>

<p>23:6. And David distributed them into courses by the families of the
sons of Levi, to wit, of Gerson, and of Caath, and of Merari.</p>

<p>23:7. The sons of Gerson were Leedan and Semei.</p>

<p>23:8. The sons of Leedan: the chief Jahiel, and Zethan, and Joel, three.</p>

<p>23:9. The sons of Semei: Salomith, and Hosiel, and Aran, three: these
were the heads of the families of Leedan.</p>

<p>23:10. And the sons of Semei were Leheth, and Ziza, and Jaus, and Baria:
these were the sons of Semei, four.</p>

<p>23:11. And Leheth was the first, Ziza the second: but Jaus and Baria had
not many children, and therefore they were counted in one family, and in
one house.</p>

<p>23:12. The sons of Caath were Amram, and Isaar, Hebron, and Oziel, four.</p>

<p>23:13. The sons of Amram, Aaron, and Moses. And Aaron was separated to
minister in the holy of holies, he and his sons for ever, and to burn
incense before the Lord, according to his ceremonies, and to bless his
name for ever.</p>

<p>23:14. The sons also of Moses, the man of God, were numbered in the
tribe of Levi.</p>

<p>23:15. The sons of Moses were Gersom and Eliezer:</p>

<p>23:16. The sons of Gersom: Subuel the first.</p>

<p>23:17. And the sons of Eliezer were: Rohobia the first: and Eliezer had
no more sons. But the sons of Rohobia were multiplied exceedingly.</p>

<p>23:18. The sons of Isaar: Salomith the first.</p>

<p>23:19. The sons of Hebron: Jeriau the first, Amarias the second,
Jahaziel the third, Jecmaam the fourth.</p>

<p>23:20. The sons of Oziel: Micha the first, Jesia the second.</p>

<p>23:21. The sons of Merari: Moholi, and Musi. The sons of Moholi: Eleazar
and Cis.</p>

<p>23:22. And Eleazar died, and had no sons but daughters: and the sons of
Cis their brethren took them.</p>

<p>23:23. The sons of Musi: Moholi, and Eder, and Jerimoth, three.</p>

<p>23:24. These are the sons of Levi in their kindreds and families,
princes by their courses, and the number of every head that did the
works of the ministry of the house of the Lord from twenty years old and
upward.</p>

<p>23:25. For David said: The Lord the God of Israel hath given rest to his
people, and a habitation in Jerusalem for ever.</p>

<p>23:26. And it shall not be the office of the Levites to carry any more
the tabernacle, and all the vessels for the service thereof.</p>

<p>23:27. So according to the last precepts of David, the sons of Levi are
to be numbered from twenty years old and upward.</p>

<p>23:28. And they are to be under the hand of the sons of Aaron for the
service of the house of the Lord, in the porches, and in the chambers,
and in the place of purification, and in the sanctuary, and in all the
works of the ministry of the temple of the Lord.</p>

<p>23:29. And the priests have the charge of the loaves of proposition, and
of the sacrifice of fine flour, and of the unleavened cakes, and of the
fryingpan, and of the roasting, and of every weight and measure.</p>

<p>23:30. And the Levites are to stand in the morning to give thanks, and
to sing praises to the Lord: and in like manner in the evening,</p>

<p>23:31. As well in the oblation of the holocausts of the Lord, as in the
sabbaths and in the new moons, and the rest of the solemnities,
according to the number and ceremonies prescribed for every thing,
continually before the Lord.</p>

<p>23:32. And let them keep the observances of the tabernacle of the
covenant, and the ceremonies of the sanctuary, and the charge of the
sons of Aaron their brethren, that they may minister in the house of the
Lord.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 24</p>

<p>The divisions of the priests into four and twenty courses, to serve in
the temple: the chiefs of the Levites.</p>

<p>24:1. Now these were the divisions of the sons of Aaron: The sons of
Aaron: Nadab, and Abiu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>

<p>24:2. But Nadab and Abiu died before their father, and had no children:
so Eleazar, and Ithamar did the office of the priesthood.</p>

<p>24:3. And David distributed them, that is, Sadoc of the sons of Eleazar,
and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their courses and
ministry.</p>

<p>24:4. And there were found many more of the sons of Eleazar among the
principal men, than of the sons of Ithamar. And he divided them so, that
there were of the sons of Eleazar, sixteen chief men by their families:
and of the sons of Ithamar eight by their families and houses.</p>

<p>24:5. And he divided both the families one with the other by lot: for
there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the
sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.</p>

<p>24:6. And Semeias the son of Nathanael the scribe a Levite, wrote them
down before the king and the princes, and Sadoc the priest, and
Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the princes also of the priestly and
Levitical families: one house, which was over the rest, of Eleazar: and
another house, which had the rest under it, of Ithamar.</p>

<p>24:7. Now the first lot came forth to Joiarib, the second to Jedei,</p>

<p>24:8. The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,</p>

<p>24:9. The fifth to Melchia, the sixth to Maiman,</p>

<p>24:10. The seventh to Accos, the eighth to Abia,</p>

<p>24:11. The ninth to Jesua, the tenth to Sechenia,</p>

<p>24:12. The eleventh to Eliasib, the twelfth to Jacim,</p>

<p>24:13. The thirteenth to Hoppha, the fourteenth to Isbaab,</p>

<p>24:14. The fifteenth to Belga, the sixteenth to Emmer,</p>

<p>24:15. The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses,</p>

<p>24:16. The nineteenth to Pheteia, the twentieth to Hezechiel,</p>

<p>24:17. The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,</p>

<p>24:18. The three and twentieth to Dalaiau, the four and twentieth to
Maaziau.</p>

<p>24:19. These are their courses according to their ministries, to come
into the house of the Lord, and according to their manner under the hand
of Aaron their father: as the Lord the God of Israel had commanded.</p>

<p>24:20. Now of the rest of the sons of Levi, there was of the sons of
Amram, Subael: and of the sons of Subael, Jehedeia.</p>

<p>24:21. Also of the sons of Rohobia the chief Jesias.</p>

<p>24:22. And the son of Isaar Salemoth, and the son of Salemoth Jahath:</p>

<p>24:23. And his son Jeriau the first, Amarias the second, Jahaziel the
third, Jecmaan the fourth.</p>

<p>24:24. The son of Oziel, Micha: the son of Micha, Samir.</p>

<p>24:25. The brother of Micha, Jesia: and the son of Jesia, Zacharias.</p>

<p>24:26. The sons of Merari: Moholi and Musi: the son of Oziau: Benno.</p>

<p>24:27. The son also of Merari Oziau, and Soam, and Zacchur, and Hebri.</p>

<p>24:28. And the son of Moholi: Eleazar, who had no sons.</p>

<p>24:29. And the son of Cis, Jeramael.</p>

<p>24:30. The sons of Musi: Moholi, Eder, and Jerimoth. These are the sons
of Levi according to the houses of their families.</p>

<p>24:31. And they also cast lots over against their brethren the sons of
Aaron before David the king, and Sadoc, and Ahimelech, and the princes
of the priestly and Levitical families, both the elder and the younger.
The lot divided all equally.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 25</p>

<p>The number and divisions of the musicians.</p>

<p>25:1. Moreover David and the chief officers of the army separated for
the ministry the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Idithun: to
prophesy with harps, and with psalteries, and with cymbals according to
their number serving in their appointed office.</p>

<p>25:2. Of the sons of Asaph: Zacchur, and Joseph, and Nathania, and
Asarela, sons of Asaph: under the hand of Asaph prophesying near the
king.</p>

<p>25:3. And of Idithun: the sons of Idithun, Godolias, Sori, Jeseias, and
Hasabias, and Mathathias, under the hand of their father Idithun, who
prophesied with a harp to give thanks and to praise the Lord.</p>

<p>25:4. Of Heman also: the sons of Heman, Bocciau, Mathaniau, Oziel,
Subuel, and Jerimoth, Hananias, Hanani, Eliatha, Geddelthi, and
Romemthiezer, and Jesbacassa, Mellothi, Othir, Mahazioth:</p>

<p>25:5. All these were the sons of Heman the seer of the king in the words
of God, to lift up the horn: and God gave to Heman fourteen sons and
three daughters.</p>

<p>25:6. All these under their father's hand were distributed to sing in
the temple of the Lord, with cymbals, and psalteries and harps, for the
service of the house of the Lord near the king: to wit, Asaph, and
Idithun, and Heman.</p>

<p>25:7. And the number of them with their brethren, that taught the song
of the Lord, all the teachers, were two hundred and eighty-eight.</p>

<p>25:8. And they cast lots by their courses, the elder equally with the
younger, the learned and the unlearned together.</p>

<p>25:9. And the first lot came forth to Joseph, who was of Asaph. &nbsp;The
second to Godolias, to him and his sons, and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:10. The third to Zachur, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:11. The fourth to Isari, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:12. The fifth to Nathania, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:13. The sixth to Bocciau, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:14. The seventh to Isreela, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:15. The eighth to Jesaia, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:16. The ninth to Mathanaias, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:17. The tenth to Semeias, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:18. The eleventh to Azareel, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:19. The twelfth to Hasabia, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:20. The thirteenth to Subael, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:21. The fourteenth to Mathathias, to his sons and his brethren
twelve.</p>

<p>25:22. The fifteenth to Jerimoth, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:23. The sixteenth to Hananias, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:24. The seventeenth to Jesbacassa, to his sons and his brethren
twelve.</p>

<p>25:25. The eighteenth to Hanani, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:26. The nineteenth to Mellothi, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:27. The twentieth to Eliatha, to his sons and his brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:28. The one and twentieth to Othir, to his sons and his brethren
twelve.</p>

<p>25:29. The two and twentieth to Geddelthi, to his sons and his brethren
twelve.</p>

<p>25:30. The three and twentieth to Mahazioth, to his sons and his
brethren twelve.</p>

<p>25:31. The four and twentieth to Romemthiezer, to his sons and his
brethren twelve.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 26</p>

<p>The divisions of the porters. Offices of other Levites.</p>

<p>26:1. And the divisions of the porters: of the Corites Meselemia, the
son of Core, of the sons of Asaph.</p>

<p>26:2. The sons of Meselemia: Zacharias the firstborn, Jadihel the
second, Zabadias the third, Jathanael the fourth,</p>

<p>26:3. Elam the fifth, Johanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh.</p>

<p>26:4. And the sons of Obededom, Semeias the firstborn, Jozabad the
second, Joaha the third, Sachar the fourth, Nathanael the fifth,</p>

<p>26:5. Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Phollathi the eighth: for
the Lord had blessed him.</p>

<p>26:6. And to Semei his son were born sons, heads of their families: for
they were men of great valour.</p>

<p>26:7. The sons then of Semeias were Othni, and Raphael, and Obed,
Elizabad, and his brethren most valiant men: and Eliu, and Samachias.</p>

<p>26:8. All these of the sons of Obededom: they, and their sons, and their
brethren most able men for service, sixty-two of Obededom.</p>

<p>26:9. And the sons of Meselemia, and their brethren strong men, were
eighteen.</p>

<p>26:10. And of Hosa, that is, of the sons of Merari: Semri the chief,
(for he had not a firstborn, and therefore his father made him chief.)</p>

<p>He had not a firstborn... That is, his firstborn was either dead or not
fit to be chief; and therefore he made Semri the chief.</p>

<p>26:11. Helcias the second, Tabelias the third, Zacharias the fourth: all
these the sons, and the brethren of Hosa, were thirteen.</p>

<p>26:12. Among these were the divisions of the porters, so that the chiefs
of the wards, as well as their brethren, always ministered in the house
of the Lord.</p>

<p>26:13. And they cast lots equally, both little and great, by their
families for every one of the gates.</p>

<p>26:14. And the lot of the east fell to Selemias. But to his son
Zacharias, a very wise and learned man, the north gate fell by lot.</p>

<p>26:15. And to Obededom and his sons that towards the south: in which
part of the house was the council of the ancients.</p>

<p>26:16. To Sephim, and Hosa towards the west, by the gate which leadeth
to the way of the ascent: ward against ward.</p>

<p>26:17. Now towards the east were six Levites: and towards the north four
a day: and towards the south likewise four a day: and where the council
was, two and two.</p>

<p>26:18. In the cells also of the porters toward the west four in the way:
and two at every cell.</p>

<p>26:19. These are the divisions of the porters of the sons of Core, and
of Merari.</p>

<p>26:20. Now Achias was over the treasures of the house of God, and the
holy vessels.</p>

<p>Holy vessels... Or vessels of the holy places, or of things holy. Vasa
sanctorum.</p>

<p>26:21. The sons of Ledan, the sons of Gersonni: of Ledan were heads of
the families, of Ledan, and Gersonni, Jehieli.</p>

<p>26:22. The sons of Jehieli: Zathan and Joel, his brethren over the
treasures of the house of the Lord,</p>

<p>26:23. With the Amramites, and Isaarites, and Hebronites, and Ozielites.</p>

<p>26:24. And Subael the son of Gersom, the son of Moses, was chief over
the treasures.</p>

<p>26:25. His brethren also, Eliezer, whose son Rohobia, and his son
Isaias, and his son Joram, and his son Zechri, and his son Selemith.</p>

<p>26:26. Which Selemith and his brethren were over the treasures of the
holy things, which king David, and the heads of families, and the
captains over thousands and over hundreds, and the captains of the host
had dedicated,</p>

<p>26:27. Out of the wars, and the spoils won in battles, which they had
consecrated to the building and furniture of the temple of the Lord.</p>

<p>26:28. And all these things that Samuel the seer and Saul the son of
Cis, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Sarvia had
sanctified: and whosoever had sanctified those things, they were under
the hand of Selemith and his brethren.</p>

<p>26:29. But Chonenias and his sons were over the Isaarites, for the
business abroad over Israel to teach them and judge them.</p>

<p>26:30. And of the Hebronites Hasabias, and his brethren most able men, a
thousand seven hundred had the charge over Israel beyond the Jordan
westward, in all the works of the Lord, and for the service of the king.</p>

<p>26:31. And the chief of the Hebronites was Jeria according to their
families and kindreds. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they
were numbered, and there were found most valiant men in Jazer Galaad,</p>

<p>26:32. And his brethren of stronger age, two thousand seven hundred
chiefs of families. And king David made them rulers over the Rubenites
and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses, for all the service of
God, and the king.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 27</p>

<p>The twelve captains for every month; the twelve princes of the tribes.
David's several officers.</p>

<p>27:1. Now the children of Israel according to their number, the heads of
families, captains of thousands and of hundreds, and officers, that
served the king according to their companies, who came in and went out
every month in the year, under every chief were four and twenty
thousand.</p>

<p>27:2. Over the first company the first month Jesboam, the son of Zabdiel
was chief, and under him were four and twenty thousand.</p>

<p>27:3. Of the sons of Phares, the chief of all the captains in the host
in the first month.</p>

<p>27:4. The company of the second month was under Dudia, an Ahohite, and
after him was another named Macelloth, who commanded a part of the army
of four and twenty thousand.</p>

<p>27:5. And the captain of the third company for the third month, was
Banaias the son of Joiada the priest: and in his division were four and
twenty thousand.</p>

<p>27:6. This is that Banaias the most valiant among the thirty, and above
the thirty. And Amizabad his son commanded his company.</p>

<p>27:7. The fourth, for the fourth month, was Asahel the brother of Joab,
and Zabadias his son after him: and in his company were four and twenty
thousand.</p>

<p>27:8. The fifth captain for the fifth month, was Samaoth a Jezerite: and
his company were four and twenty thousand.</p>

<p>27:9. The sixth, for the sixth month, was Hira the son of Acces a
Thecuite: and in his company were four and twenty thousand.</p>

<p>27:10. The seventh, for the seventh month, was Helles a Phallonite of
the sons of Ephraim: and in his company were four and twenty thousand.</p>

<p>27:11. The eighth, for the eighth month, was Sobochai a Husathite of the
race of Zarahi: and in his company were four and twenty thousand.</p>

<p>27:12. The ninth, for the ninth month, was Abiezer an Anathothite of the
sons of Jemini, and in his company were four and twenty thousand.</p>

<p>27:13. The tenth, for the tenth month, was Marai, who was a Netophathite
of the race of Zarai: and in his company were four and twenty thousand.</p>

<p>27:14. The eleventh, for the eleventh month, was Banaias, a Pharathonite
of the sons of Ephraim: and in his company were four and twenty
thousand.</p>

<p>27:15. The twelfth, for the twelfth month, was Holdai a Netophathite, of
the race of Gothoniel: and in his company were four and twenty thousand.</p>

<p>27:16. Now the chiefs over the tribes of Israel were these: over the
Rubenites, Eliezer the son of Zechri was ruler: over the Simeonites,
Saphatias the son of Maacha:</p>

<p>27:17. Over the Levites, Hasabias the son of Camuel: over the Aaronites,
Sadoc:</p>

<p>27:18. Over Juda, Eliu the brother of David over Issachar, Amri the son
of Michael:</p>

<p>27:19. Over the Zabulonites, Jesmaias the son of Adias: over the
Nephtalites, Jerimoth the son of Ozriel:</p>

<p>27:20. Over the sons of Ephraim, Osee the son of Ozaziu: over the half
tribe of Manasses, Joel the son of Phadaia:</p>

<p>27:21. And over the half tribe of Manasses in Galaad, Jaddo the son of
Zacharias: and over Benjamin, Jasiel the son of Abner.</p>

<p>27:22. And over Dan, Ezrihel the son of Jeroham: these were the princes
of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>27:23. But David would not number them from twenty years old and under:
because the lord had said that he would multiply Israel like the stars
of heaven.</p>

<p>27:24. Joab the son of Sarvia began to number, but he finished not:
because upon this there fell wrath upon Israel: and therefore the number
of them that were numbered, was not registered in the chronicles of king
David.</p>

<p>27:25. And over the king's treasures was Azmoth the son of Adiel: and
over those stores which were in the cities, and in the villages, and, in
the castles, was Jonathan the son of Ozias.</p>

<p>27:26. And over the tillage, and the husbandmen, who tilled the ground,
was Ezri the son of Chelub:</p>

<p>27:27. And over the dressers of the vine yards, was Semeias a Romathite:
and over the wine cellars, Zabdias an Aphonite.</p>

<p>27:28. And over the oliveyards and the fig groves, which were in the
plains, was Balanam a Gederite: and over the oil cellars, Joas.</p>

<p>27:29. And over the herds that fed in Saron, was Setrai a Saronite: and
over the oxen in the valleys, Saphat the son of Adli:</p>

<p>27:30. And over the camels, Ubil an Ishmahelite and over the asses,
Jadias a Meronathite:</p>

<p>27:31. And over the sheep Jaziz an Agarene. All these were the rulers of
the substance of king David.</p>

<p>27:32. And Jonathan David's uncle, a counsellor, a wise and learned man:
he and Jahiel the son of Hachamoni were with the king's sons.</p>

<p>27:33. And Achitophel was the king's counsellor, and Chusai the
Arachite, the king's friend.</p>

<p>27:34. And after Achitophel was Joiada the son of Banaias, and Abiathar.
And the general of the king's army was Joab.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 28</p>

<p>David's speech, in a solemn assembly: his exhortation to Solomon. He
giveth him a pattern of the temple.</p>

<p>28:1. And David assembled all the chief men of Israel, the princes of
the tribes, and the captains of the companies, who waited on the king:
and the captains over thousands, and over hundreds, and them who had the
charge over the substance and possessions of the king, and his sons with
the officers of the court, and the men of power, and all the bravest of
the army at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>28:2. And the king rising up, and standing said: Hear me, my brethren
and my people: I had a thought to have built a house, in which the ark
of the Lord, and the footstool of our God might rest: and prepared all
things for the building.</p>

<p>28:3. And God said to me: Thou shalt not build a house to my name:
because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood.</p>

<p>28:4. But the Lord God of Israel chose me of all the house of my father,
to be king over Israel for ever: for of Juda he chose the princes: and
of the house of Juda, my father's house: and among the sons of my
father, it pleased him to choose me king over all Israel.</p>

<p>28:5. And among my sons (for the Lord hath given me many sons) he hath
chosen Solomon my son, to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord
over Israel.</p>

<p>28:6. And he said to me: Solomon thy son shall build my house, and my
courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be a father to
him.</p>

<p>28:7. And I will establish his kingdom for ever, it he continue to keep
my commandments, and my judgments, as at this day.</p>

<p>28:8. Now then before all the assembly of Israel, in the hearing of our
God, keep ye, and seek all the commandments of the Lord our God: that
you may possess the good land, and may leave it to your children after
you for ever.</p>

<p>28:9. And thou my son Solomon, know the God of thy father, and serve him
with a perfect heart, and a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth all
hearts, and understandeth all the thoughts of minds. If thou seek him,
thou shalt find him: but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for
ever.</p>

<p>28:10. Now therefore seeing the Lord hath chosen thee to build the house
of the sanctuary, take courage, and do it.</p>

<p>28:11. And David gave to Solomon his son a description of the porch, and
of the temple, and of the treasures, and of the upper floor, and of the
inner chambers, and of the house for the mercy seat,</p>

<p>28:12. As also of all the courts, which he had in his thought, and of
the chambers round about, for the treasures of the house of the Lord,
and for the treasures of the consecrated things,</p>

<p>28:13. And of the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, for all
the works of the house of the Lord, and for all the vessels of the
service of the temple of the Lord.</p>

<p>28:14. Gold by weight for every vessel for the ministry. And silver by
weight according to the diversity of the vessels and uses.</p>

<p>28:15. He gave also gold for the golden candlesticks, and their lamps,
according to the dimensions of every candlestick, and the lamps thereof.
In like manner also he gave silver by weight for the silver
candlesticks, and for their lamps according to the diversity of the
dimensions of them.</p>

<p>28:16. He gave also gold for the tables of proposition, according to the
diversity of the tables: in like manner also silver for other tables of
silver.</p>

<p>28:17. For fleshhooks also, and bowls, and censors of fine gold, and for
little lions of gold, according to the measure he gave by weight, for
every lion. In like manner also for lions of silver he set aside a
different weight of silver.</p>

<p>28:18. And for the altar of incense, he gave the purest gold: and to
make the likeness of the chariot of the cherubims spreading their wings,
and covering the ark of the covenant of the Lord.</p>

<p>28:19. All these things, said he, came to me written by the hand of the
Lord that I might understand all the works of the pattern.</p>

<p>28:20. And David said to Solomon his son: Act like a man, and take
courage, and do: fear not, and be not dismayed: for the Lord my God will
be with thee, and will not leave thee, nor forsake thee, till thou hast
finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord.</p>

<p>28:21. Behold the courses of the priests and the Levites, for every
ministry of the house of the Lord, stand by thee, and are ready, and
both the princes, and the people know how to execute all thy
commandments.</p>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 29</p>

<p>David by word and example encourageth the princes to contribute
liberally to the building of the temple. His thanksgiving, prayer, and
sacrifices: his death.</p>

<p>29:1. And king David said to all the assembly: Solomon my son, whom
alone God hath chosen, is as yet young and tender: and the work is
great, for a house is prepared not for man, but for God.</p>

<p>29:2. And I with all my ability have prepared the expenses for the house
of my God. Gold for vessels of gold, and silver for vessels of silver,
brass for things of brass, iron for things of iron, wood for things of
wood: and onyx stones, and stones like alabaster, and of divers colours,
and all manner of precious stones, and marble of Paros in great
abundance.</p>

<p>29:3. Now over and above the things which I have offered into the house
of my God I give of my own proper goods, gold and silver for the temple
of my God, beside what things I have prepared for the holy house.</p>

<p>29:4. Three thousand talents of gold of the gold of Ophir: and seven
thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the temple.</p>

<p>29:5. And gold for wheresoever there is need of gold: and silver for
wheresoever there is need of silver, for the works to be made by the
hands of the artificers: now if any man is willing to offer, let him
fill his hand to day, and offer what he pleaseth to the Lord.</p>

<p>29:6. Then the heads of the families, and the princes of the tribes of
Israel and the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and the overseers
of the king's possessions promised,</p>

<p>29:7. And they gave for the works of the house of the Lord, of gold,
five thousand talents, and ten thousand solids: of silver ten thousand
talents: and of brass eighteen thousand talents: and of iron a hundred
thousand talents.</p>

<p>29:8. And all they that had stones, gave them to the treasures of the
house of the Lord, by the hand of Jahiel the Gersonite.</p>

<p>29:9. And the people rejoiced, when they promised their offerings
willingly: because they offered them to the Lord with all their heart:
and David the king rejoiced also with a great joy.</p>

<p>29:10. And he blessed the Lord before all the multitude, and he said:
Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of Israel, our father from eternity to
eternity.</p>

<p>29:11. Thine, O Lord, is magnificence, and power, and glory, and
victory: and to thee is praise: for all that is in heaven, and in earth,
is thine: thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art above all princes.</p>

<p>29:12. Thine are riches, and thine is glory, thou hast dominion over
all, in thy hand is power and might: in thy hand greatness, and the
empire of all things.</p>

<p>29:13. Now therefore our God we give thanks to thee, and we praise thy
glorious name.</p>

<p>29:14. Who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to
promise thee all these things? all things are thine: and we have given
thee what we received of thy hand.</p>

<p>29:15. For we are sojourners before thee, and strangers, as were all our
fathers. I Our days upon earth are as a shadow, and there is no stay.</p>

<p>29:16. O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build
thee a house for thy holy name, is from thy hand, and all things are
thine.</p>

<p>29:17. I know my God that thou provest hearts, and lovest simplicity,
wherefore I also in the simplicity of my heart, have joyfully offered
all these things: and I have seen with great joy thy people, which are
here present, offer thee their offerings.</p>

<p>29:18. O Lord God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Israel our fathers,
keep for ever this will of their heart, and let this mind remain always
for the worship of thee.</p>

<p>29:19. And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, that he may keep thy
commandments, thy testimonies, and thy ceremonies, and do all things:
and build the house, for which I have provided the charges.</p>

<p>29:20. And David commanded all the assembly: Bless ye the Lord our God.
And all the assembly blessed the Lord the God of their fathers: and they
bowed themselves and worshipped God, and then the king.</p>

<p>29:21. And they sacrificed victims to the Lord: and they offered
holocausts the next day, a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a
thousand lambs, with their libations, and with every thing prescribed
most abundantly for all Israel.</p>

<p>29:22. And they ate, and drank before the Lord that day with great joy.
And they anointed the second time Solomon the son of David. And they
anointed him to the Lord to be prince, and Sadoc to be high priest.</p>

<p>29:23. And Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of
David his father, and he pleased all: and all Israel obeyed him.</p>

<p>29:24. And all the princes, and men of power, and all the sons of king
David gave their hand, and were subject to Solomon the king.</p>

<p>29:25. And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel: and gave him the
glory of a reign, such as no king of Israel had before him.</p>

<p>29:26. So David the son of Isai reigned over all Israel.</p>

<p>29:27. And the days that he reigned over Israel, were forty years: in
Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem three and thirty years.</p>

<p>29:28. And he died in a good age, full of days, and riches, and glory.
And Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>29:29. Now the acts of king David first and last are written in the book
of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the
book of Gad the seer:</p>

<p>29:30. And of all his reign, and his valour, and of the times that
passed under him, either in Israel, or in all the kingdoms of the
countries.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
