<p>THE APOCALYPSE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE</p>

<p>In the first, second, and third chapters of this Book are contained
instructions and admonitions which St. John was commanded to write to
the seven bishops of the churches in Asia. And in the following
chapters, to the end, are contained prophecies of things that are to
come to pass in the Church of Christ, particularly towards the end of
the world, in the time of Antichrist. It was written in Greek, in the
island of Patmos, where St. John was in banishment by order of the cruel
emperor Domitian, about sixty-four years after our Lord's Ascension.</p>

<p>
Apocalypse Chapter 1</p>

<p>St. John is ordered to write to the seven churches in Asia. The manner
of Christ's appearing to him.</p>

<p>1:1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to make
known to his servants the things which must shortly come to pass: and
signified, sending by his angel to his servant John,</p>

<p>The things which must shortly come... and again it is said, ver. 3, The
time is at hand... This can not be meant of all the things prophesied in
the Apocalypse, where mention is made also of the day of judgment, and
of the glory of heaven at the end of the world. That some things were to
come to pass shortly, is evident, by what is said to the Seven Churches,
chap. 2 and 3, Or that the persecutions foretold should begin shortly.
Or that these words signified, that all time is short, and that from the
coming of Christ, we are now in the last age or last hour. See 1 John
2.18.</p>

<p>1:2. Who hath given testimony to the word of God and the testimony of
Jesus Christ, what things soever he hath seen.</p>

<p>1:3. Blessed is he that readeth and heareth the words of this prophecy:
and keepeth those things which are written in it. For the time is at
hand.</p>

<p>1:4. John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace be unto you and
peace, from him that is and that was and that is to come: and from the
seven spirits which are before his throne:</p>

<p>1:5. And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first
begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth, who hath
loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</p>

<p>1:6. And hath made us a kingdom, and priests to God and his Father. &nbsp;To
him be glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>1:7. Behold, he cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see him: and
they also that pierced him. And all the tribes of the earth shall bewail
themselves because of him. Even so. Amen.</p>

<p>1:8. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, saith the Lord
God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.</p>

<p>I am Alpha and Omega... These are the names of the first and last
letters of the Greek alphabet, and signify the same as what follows: The
beginning and the end: the first cause and last end of all beings: who
is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty... These words signify
the true God only, and are here applied to our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ, who is to come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>

<p>1:9. I, John, your brother and your partner in tribulation and in the
kingdom and patience in Christ Jesus, was in the island which is called
Patmos, for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus.</p>

<p>1:10. I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great
voice, as of a trumpet,</p>

<p>1:11. Saying: What thou seest, write in a book and send to the seven
churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamus and
to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.</p>

<p>1:12. And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being
turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks:</p>

<p>1:13. And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, one like to the
Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the feet, and girt about the
paps with a golden girdle.</p>

<p>1:14. And his head and his hairs were white as white wool and as snow.
And his eyes were as a flame of fire:</p>

<p>1:15. And his feet like unto fine brass, as in a burning furnace. &nbsp;And
his voice as the sound of many waters.</p>

<p>1:16. And he had in his right hand seven stars. And from his mouth came
out a sharp two-edged sword. And his face was as the sun shineth in his
power.</p>

<p>1:17. And when I had seen him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid
his right hand upon me, saying: Fear not. I am the First and the Last,</p>

<p>1:18. And alive, and was dead. And behold I am living for ever and ever
and have the keys of death and of hell.</p>

<p>1:19. Write therefore the things which thou hast seen: and which are:
and which must be done hereafter.</p>

<p>1:20. The mystery of the seven stars, which thou sawest in my right hand
and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the
seven churches. And the seven candlesticks are the seven churches.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 2</p>

<p>Directions what to write to the angels or bishops of Ephesus, Smyrna,
Pergamus and Thyatira.</p>

<p>2:1. Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write: These things saith
he who holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the
midst of the seven golden candlesticks:</p>

<p>2:2. I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst
not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are
apostles and are not: and hast found them liars:</p>

<p>2:3. And thou hast patience and hast endured for my name and hast not
fainted.</p>

<p>2:4. But I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first
charity.</p>

<p>2:5. Be mindful therefore from whence thou art fallen: and do penance
and do the first works. Or else I come to thee and will move thy
candlestick out of its place, except thou do penance.</p>

<p>2:6. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaites,
which I also hate.</p>

<p>2:7. He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches: To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life
which is in the paradise of my God.</p>

<p>2:8. And to the angel of the church of Smyrna write: These things saith
the First and the Last, who was dead and is alive:</p>

<p>2:9. I know thy tribulation and thy poverty: but thou art rich. &nbsp;And
thou art blasphemed by them that say they are Jews and are not, but are
the synagogue of Satan.</p>

<p>2:10. Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the
devil will cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried: and you
shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death: and I will
give thee the crown of life.</p>

<p>2:11. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches: He that shall overcome shall not be hurt by the second death.</p>

<p>2:12. And to the angel of the church of Pergamus write: These things
saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword:</p>

<p>2:13. I know where thou dwellest, where the seat of Satan is. And thou
holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith. Even in those days
when Antipas was my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where
Satan dwelleth.</p>

<p>2:14. But I have against thee a few things: because thou hast there them
that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balac to cast a
stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat and to commit
fornication.</p>

<p>2:15. So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaites.</p>

<p>2:16. In like manner do penance. If not, I will come to thee quickly and
will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</p>

<p>2:17. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches: To him that overcometh I will give the hidden manna and will
give him a white counter: and in the counter, a new name written, which
no man knoweth but he that receiveth it.</p>

<p>2:18. And to the angel of the church of Thyatira write: These things
saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like to a flame of fire and his
feet like to fine brass.</p>

<p>2:19. I know thy works and thy faith and thy charity and thy ministry
and thy patience and thy last works, which are more than the former.</p>

<p>2:20. But I have against thee a few things: because thou sufferest the
woman Jezabel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce
my servants, to commit fornication and to eat of things sacrificed to
idols.</p>

<p>2:21. And I gave her a time that she might do penance: and she will not
repent of her fornication.</p>

<p>2:22. Behold, I will cast her into a bed: and they that commit adultery
with her shall be in very great tribulation, except they do penance from
their deeds,</p>

<p>2:23. And I will kill her children with death: and all the churches
shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts. And I will
give to every one of you according to your works. But to you I say,</p>

<p>2:24. And to the rest who are at Thyatira: Whosoever have not this
doctrine and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say: I will
not put upon you any other burthen.</p>

<p>2:25. Yet that which you have, hold fast till I come.</p>

<p>2:26. And he that shall overcome and keep my words unto the end, I will
give him power over the nations.</p>

<p>Power over the nations... This shews, that the saints, who are with
Christ our Lord in heaven, receive power from him to preside over
nations and provinces, as patrons; and shall come with him at the end of
the world to execute his will against those who have not kept his
commandments.</p>

<p>2:27. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and as the vessel of a
potter they shall be broken:</p>

<p>2:28. As I also have received of my Father. And I will give him the
morning star.</p>

<p>2:29. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 3</p>

<p>Directions what to write to Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.</p>

<p>3:1. And to the angel of the church of Sardis write: These things saith
he that hath the seven spirits of God and the seven stars: I know thy
works, and that thou hast the name of being alive. &nbsp;And thou art dead.</p>

<p>3:2. Be watchful and strengthen the things that remain, which are ready
to die. For I find not thy works full before my God.</p>

<p>3:3. Have in mind therefore in what manner thou hast received and heard:
and observe and do penance: If then thou shalt not watch, I will come to
thee as a thief: and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come to
thee.</p>

<p>3:4. But thou hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their
garments: and they shall walk with me in white, because they are worthy.</p>

<p>3:5. He that shall overcome shall thus be clothed in white garments: and
I will not blot out his name out of the book of life. And I will confess
his name before my Father and before his angels.</p>

<p>3:6. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches.</p>

<p>3:7. And to the angel of the church of Philadelphia write: These things
saith the Holy One and the true one, he that hath the key of David, he
that openeth and no man shutteth, shutteth and no man openeth:</p>

<p>3:8. I know thy works. Behold, I have given before thee a door opened,
which no man can shut: because thou hast a little strength and hast kept
my word and hast not denied my name.</p>

<p>3:9. Behold, I will bring of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are
Jews and are not, but do lie. Behold, I will make them to come and adore
before thy feet. And they shall know that I have loved thee.</p>

<p>3:10. Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I will also keep
thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon the whole world
to try them that dwell upon the earth.</p>

<p>3:11. Behold, I come quickly: hold fast that which thou hast, that no
man take thy crown.</p>

<p>3:12. He that shall overcome, I will make him a pillar in the temple of
my God: and he shall go out no more. And I will write upon him the name
of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which
cometh down out of heaven from my God, and my new name.</p>

<p>3:13. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches.</p>

<p>3:14. And to the angel of the church of Laodicea write: These things
saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, who is the beginning of
the creation of God:</p>

<p>The Amen... that is, the true one, the Truth itself; the Word and Son
of God. The beginning,`&iuml; '&agrave;px&iuml;... that is, the principle, the source,
and the efficient cause of the whole creation.</p>

<p>3:15. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot. I would thou
wert cold or hot.</p>

<p>3:16. But because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will
begin to vomit thee out of my mouth.</p>

<p>3:17. Because thou sayest: I am rich and made wealthy and have need of
nothing: and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor
and blind and naked.</p>

<p>3:18. I counsel thee to buy of me gold, fire tried, that thou mayest be
made rich and mayest be clothed in white garments: and that the shame of
thy nakedness may not appear. And anoint thy eyes with eyesalve, that
thou mayest see.</p>

<p>3:19. Such as I love, I rebuke and chastise. Be zealous therefore and do
penance.</p>

<p>3:20. Behold, I stand at the gate and knock. If any man shall hear my
voice and open to me the door, I will come in to him and will sup with
him: and he with me.</p>

<p>3:21. To him that shall overcome, I will give to sit with me in my
throne: as I also have overcome and am set down with my Father in his
throne.</p>

<p>3:22. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
churches.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 4</p>

<p>The vision of the throne of God, the twenty-four ancients and the four
living creatures.</p>

<p>4:1. Aftengs which must be done hereafter.</p>

<p>4:2. And immediately I was in the spirit. And behold, there was a throne
set in heaven, and upon the throne one sitting.</p>

<p>4:3. And he that sat was to the sight like the jasper and the sardine
stone. And there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like
unto an emerald.</p>

<p>4:4. And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the
seats, four and twenty ancients sitting, clothed in white garments. And
on their heads were crowns of gold.</p>

<p>4:5. And from the throne proceeded lightnings and voices and thunders.
And there were seven lamps burning before the throne, which are the
seven Spirits of God.</p>

<p>4:6. And in the sight of the throne was, as it were, a sea of glass like
to crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne,
were four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind.</p>

<p>4:7. And the first living creature was like a lion: and the second
living creature like a calf: and the third living creature, having the
face, as it were, of a man: and the fourth living creature was like an
eagle flying.</p>

<p>4:8. And the four living creatures had each of them six wings: and round
about and within they are full of eyes. And they rested not day and
night, saying: Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, who was and who is
and who is to come.</p>

<p>4:9. And when those living creatures gave glory and honour and
benediction to him that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for ever and
ever:</p>

<p>4:10. The four and twenty ancients fell down before him that sitteth on
the throne and adored him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their
crowns before the throne, saying:</p>

<p>4:11. Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory and honour and
power. Because thou hast created all things: and for thy will they were
and have been created.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 5</p>

<p>The book sealed with seven seals is opened by the Lamb, who thereupon
receives adoration and praise from all.</p>

<p>5:1. And I saw, in the right hand of him that sat on the throne, a book,
written within and without, sealed with seven seals.</p>

<p>5:2. And I saw a strong angel, proclaiming with a loud voice: Who is
worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?</p>

<p>5:3. And no man was able, neither in heaven nor on earth nor under the
earth, to open the book, nor to look on it.</p>

<p>5:4. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open the book,
nor to see it.</p>

<p>5:5. And one of the ancients said to me: Weep not: behold the lion of
the tribe of Juda, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book
and to loose the seven seals thereof.</p>

<p>5:6. And I saw: and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four
living creatures and in the midst of the ancients, a Lamb standing, as
it were slain, having seven horns and seven eyes: which are the seven
Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.</p>

<p>5:7. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat
on the throne.</p>

<p>5:8. And when he had opened the book, the four living creatures and the
four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb, having every one of
them harps and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of
saints.</p>

<p>The prayers of saints... Here we see that the saints in heaven offer up
to Christ the prayers of the faithful upon earth.</p>

<p>5:9. And they sung a new canticle, saying: Thou art worthy, O Lord, to
take the book and to open the seals thereof: because thou wast slain and
hast redeemed us to God, in thy blood, out of every tribe and tongue and
people and nation:</p>

<p>5:10. And hast made us to our God a kingdom and priests, and we shall
reign on the earth.</p>

<p>5:11. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the
throne and the living creatures and the ancients (and the number of them
was thousands of thousands),</p>

<p>5:12. Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to
receive power and divinity and wisdom and strength and honour and glory
and benediction.</p>

<p>5:13. And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under
the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard
all saying: To him that sitteth on the throne and to the Lamb,
benediction and honour and glory and power, for ever and ever.</p>

<p>5:14. And the four living creatures said: Amen. And the four and twenty
ancients fell down on their faces and adored him that liveth for ever
and ever.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 6</p>

<p>What followed upon opening six of the seals.</p>

<p>6:1. And I saw that the Lamb had opened one of the seven seals: and I
heard one of the four living creatures, as it were the voice of thunder,
saying: Come and see.</p>

<p>6:2. And I saw: and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a
bow, and there was a crown given him, and he went forth conquering that
he might conquer.</p>

<p>White horse... He that sitteth on the white horse is Christ, going forth
to subdue the world by his gospel. The other horses that follow
represent the judgments and punishment that were to fall on the enemies
of Christ and his church. The red horse signifies war; the black horse,
famine; and the pale horse (which has Death for its rider), plagues or
pestilence.</p>

<p>6:3. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living
creature saying: Come and see.</p>

<p>6:4. And there went out another horse that was red. And to him that sat
thereon, it was given that he should take peace from the earth: and that
they should kill one another. And a great sword was given to him.</p>

<p>6:5. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living
creature saying: Come and see. And behold a black horse. &nbsp;And he that
sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.</p>

<p>6:6. And I heard, as it were a voice in the midst of the four living
creatures, saying: Two pounds of wheat for a penny, and thrice two
pounds of barley for a penny: and see thou hurt not the wine and the
oil.</p>

<p>6:7. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the
fourth living creature saying: Come and see.</p>

<p>6:8. And behold a pale horse: and he that sat upon him, his name was
Death. And hell followed him. And power was given to him over the four
parts of the earth, to kill with sword, with famine and with death and
with the beasts of the earth.</p>

<p>6:9. And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the
souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony
which they held.</p>

<p>Under the altar... Christ, as man, is this altar, under which the souls
of the martyrs live in heaven, as their bodies are here deposited under
our altars.</p>

<p>6:10. And they cried with a loud voice, saying: How long, O Lord (Holy
and True), dost thou not judge and revenge our blood on them that dwell
on the earth?</p>

<p>Revenge our blood... They ask not this out of hatred to their enemies,
but out of zeal for the glory of God, and a desire that the Lord would
accelerate the general judgment, and the complete beatitude of all his
elect.</p>

<p>6:11. And white robes were given to every one of them one; And it was
said to them that they should rest for a little time till their fellow
servants and their brethren, who are to be slain even as they, should be
filled up.</p>

<p>6:12. And I saw, when he had opened the sixth seal: and behold there was
a great earthquake. And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair: and
the whole moon became as blood.</p>

<p>6:13. And the stars from heaven fell upon the earth, as the fig tree
casteth its green figs when it is shaken by a great wind.</p>

<p>6:14. And the heaven departed as a book folded up. And every mountain,
and the islands, were moved out of their places.</p>

<p>6:15. And the kings of the earth and the princes and tribunes and the
rich and the strong and every bondman and every freeman hid themselves
in the dens and in the rocks of mountains:</p>

<p>6:16. And they say to the mountains and the rocks: Fall upon us and hide
us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne and from the wrath
of the Lamb.</p>

<p>6:17. For the great day of their wrath is come. And who shall be able to
stand?</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 7</p>

<p>The number of them that were marked with the seal of the living God and
clothed in white robes.</p>

<p>7:1. After these things, I saw four angels standing on the four corners
of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that they should not
blow upon the earth nor upon the sea nor on any tree.</p>

<p>7:2. And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun,
having the sign of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the
four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,</p>

<p>7:3. Saying: Hurt not the earth nor the sea nor the trees, till we sign
the servants of our God in their foreheads.</p>

<p>7:4. And I heard the number of them that were signed. An hundred forty-
four thousand were signed, of every tribe of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>7:5. Of the tribe of Juda, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of
Ruben, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand
signed:</p>

<p>7:6. Of the tribe of Aser, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of
Nephthali, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Manasses, twelve
thousand signed:</p>

<p>7:7. Of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of
Levi, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand
signed:</p>

<p>7:8. Of the tribe of Zabulon, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of
Joseph, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve
thousand signed.</p>

<p>7:9. After this, I saw a great multitude, which no man could number, of
all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the
throne and in sight of the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in
their hands.</p>

<p>7:10. And they cried with a loud voice, saying: Salvation to our God,
who sitteth upon the throne and to the Lamb.</p>

<p>7:11. And all the angels stood round about the throne and the ancients
and the four living creatures. And they fell down before the throne upon
their faces and adored God,</p>

<p>7:12. Saying: Amen. Benediction and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving,
honour and power and strength, to our God, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>7:13. And one of the ancients answered and said to me: These that are
clothed in white robes, who are they? And whence came they?</p>

<p>7:14. And I said to him: My Lord, thou knowest. And he said to me: These
are they who are come out of great tribulation and have washed their
robes and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</p>

<p>7:15. Therefore, they are before the throne of God: and they serve him
day and night in his temple. And he that sitteth on the throne shall
dwell over them.</p>

<p>7:16. They shall no more hunger nor thirst: neither shall the sun fall
on them, nor any heat.</p>

<p>7:17. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall rule them
and shall lead them to the fountains of the waters of life: and God
shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 8</p>

<p>The seventh seal is opened. The angels with the seven trumpets.</p>

<p>8:1. And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in
heaven, as it were for half an hour.</p>

<p>8:2. And I saw seven angels standing in the presence of God: and there
were given to them seven trumpets.</p>

<p>8:3. And another angel came and stood before the altar, having a golden
censer: and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer of
the prayers of all saints, upon the golden altar which is before the
throne of God.</p>

<p>8:4. And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints ascended
up before God from the hand of the angel.</p>

<p>8:5. And the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the
altar and cast it on the earth: and there were thunders and voices and
lightnings and a great earthquake.</p>

<p>8:6. And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves
to sound the trumpet.</p>

<p>8:7. And the first angel sounded the trumpet: and there followed hail
and fire, mingled with blood: and it was cast on the earth. &nbsp;And the
third part of the earth was burnt up: and the third part of the trees
was burnt up: and all green grass was burnt up.</p>

<p>8:8. And the second angel sounded the trumpet: and, as it were, a great
mountain, burning with fire, was cast into the sea. And the third part
of the sea became blood.</p>

<p>8:9. And the third part of those creatures died which had life in the
sea: and the third part of the ships was destroyed.</p>

<p>8:10. And the third angel sounded the trumpet: and a great star fell
from heaven, burning as it were a torch. And it fell on the third part
of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters:</p>

<p>8:11. And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And the third part of
the waters became wormwood. And many men died of the waters, because
they were made bitter.</p>

<p>8:12. And the fourth angel sounded the trumpet: and the third part of
the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part
of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened. And the day
did not shine for a third part of it: and the night in like manner.</p>

<p>8:13. And I beheld: and heard the voice of one eagle flying through the
midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice: Woe, Woe, Woe to the
inhabitants of the earth, by reason of the rest of the voices of the
three angels, who are yet to sound the trumpet!</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 9</p>

<p>Locusts come forth from the bottomless pit. The vision of the army of
horsemen.</p>

<p>9:1. And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet: and I saw a star fall from
heaven upon the earth. And there was given to him the key of the
bottomless pit.</p>

<p>A star full... This may mean the fall and apostasy of great and learned
men from the true faith. Or a whole nation falling into error and
separating from the church, not having the sign of God in their
foreheads. And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit...
That is, to the angel, not to the fallen star. &nbsp;To this angel was given
the power, which is here signified by a key, of opening hell.</p>

<p>9:2. And he opened the bottomless pit: and the smoke of the pit arose,
as the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened
with the smoke of the pit.</p>

<p>9:3. And from the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon the
earth. And power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have
power.</p>

<p>There came out locusts... These may be devils in Antichrist's time,
having the appearance of locusts, but large and monstrous, as here
described. Or they may be real locusts, but of an extraordinary size and
monstrous shape, such as were never before seen on earth, sent to
torment those who have not the sign (or seal) of God on their foreheads.
Some commentators by these locusts understand heretics, and especially
those heretics, that sprung from Jews, and with them denied the divinity
of Jesus Christ; as Theodotus, Praxeas, Noetus, Paul of Samosata,
Sabellius, Arius, etc. These were great enemies of the Christian
religion; they tormented and infected the souls of men, stinging them
like scorpions, with the poison of their heresies. Others have explained
these locusts, and other animals, mentioned in different places
throughout this sacred and mystical book, in a most absurd, fanciful,
and ridiculous manner; they make Abaddon the Pope, and the locusts to be
friars mendicant, etc. Here it is thought proper, not to enter into any
controversy upon that subject, as the inventors of these fancies have
been already answered, and fully refuted by many controvertists:
besides, those who might be inposed on by such chimerical writers, are
in these days much better informed.</p>

<p>9:4. And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of
the earth nor any green thing nor any tree: but only the men who have
not the sign of God on their foreheads.</p>

<p>9:5. And it was given unto them that they should not kill them: but that
they should torment them five months. And their torment was as the
torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man.</p>

<p>9:6. And in those days, men shall seek death and shall not find it. And
they shall desire to die: and death shall fly from them.</p>

<p>9:7. And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto
battle. And on their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold: and their
faces were as the faces of men.</p>

<p>9:8. And they had hair as the hair of women: and their teeth were as
lions.</p>

<p>9:9. And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron: and the noise of
their wings was as the noise of chariots and many horses running to
battle.</p>

<p>9:10. And they had tails like to scorpions: and there were stings in
their tails. And their power was to hurt men, five months. &nbsp;And they had
over them</p>

<p>9:11. A king, the angel of the bottomless pit (whose name in Hebrew is
Abaddon and in Greek Apollyon, in Latin Exterminans).</p>

<p>9:12. One woe is past: and behold there come yet two woes more
hereafter.</p>

<p>9:13. And the sixth angel sounded the trumpet: and I heard a voice from
the four horns of the golden altar which is before the eyes of God,</p>

<p>9:14. Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet: Loose the four
angels who are bound in the great river Euphrates.</p>

<p>9:15. And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour,
and a day, and a month, and a year: for to kill the third part of men.</p>

<p>9:16. And the number of the army of horsemen was twenty thousand times
ten thousand. And I heard the number of them.</p>

<p>9:17. And thus I saw the horses in the vision. And they that sat on them
had breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone. And the heads
of the horses were as the heads of lions: and from their mouths
proceeded fire and smoke and brimstone.</p>

<p>9:18. And by these three plagues was slain the third part of men, by the
fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their
mouths.</p>

<p>9:19. For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails.
For, their tails are like to serpents and have heads: and with them they
hurt.</p>

<p>9:20. And the rest of the men, who were not slain by these plagues, did
not do penance from the works of their hands, that they should not adore
devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which
neither can see nor hear nor walk:</p>

<p>9:21. Neither did they penance from their murders nor from their
sorceries nor from their fornication nor from their thefts.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 10</p>

<p>The cry of a mighty angel. He gives John a book to eat.</p>

<p>10:1. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with
a cloud. And a rainbow was on his head: and his face, as the sun, and
his feet as pillars of fire.</p>

<p>10:2. And he had in his hand a little book, open. And he set his right
foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth.</p>

<p>10:3. And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth. And when he
had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.</p>

<p>10:4. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about
to write. And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me: Seal up the
things which the seven thunders have spoken. And write them not.</p>

<p>10:5. And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth
lifted up his hand to heaven.</p>

<p>10:6. And he swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created
heaven and the things which are therein, and the earth and the things
which are in it, and the sea and the things which are therein: That time
shall be no longer.</p>

<p>10:7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall
begin to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God shall be finished, as he
hath declared by his servants the prophets.</p>

<p>Declared... literally evangelized, to signify the good tidings,
agreeable to the Gospel, of the final victory of Christ, and of that
eternal life, which should be the reward of the temporal sufferings of
the martyrs and faithful servants of God.</p>

<p>10:8. And I heard a voice from heaven, again speaking to me and saying:
Go and take the book that is open, from the hand of the angel who
standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.</p>

<p>10:9. And I went to the angel, saying unto him that he should give me
the book. And he said to me: Take the book and eat it up. And it shall
make thy belly bitter: but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey.</p>

<p>10:10. And I took the book from the hand of the angel and ate it up: and
it was in my mouth, sweet as honey. And when I had eaten it, my belly
was bitter.</p>

<p>10:11. And he said to me: Thou must prophesy again to many nations and
peoples and tongues and kings.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 11</p>

<p>He is ordered to measure the temple. The two witnesses.</p>

<p>11:1. And there was given me a reed, like unto a rod. And it was said to
me: Arise, and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that
adore therein.</p>

<p>11:2. But the court which is without the temple, cast out and measure it
not: because it is given unto the Gentiles. And the holy city they shall
tread under foot, two and forty months:</p>

<p>11:3. And I will give unto my two witnesses: and they shall prophesy, a
thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.</p>

<p>My two witnesses... It is commonly understood of Henoch and Elias.</p>

<p>11:4. These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks that stand
before the Lord of the earth.</p>

<p>11:5. And if any man will hurt them, fire shall come out of their mouths
and shall devour their enemies. And if any man will hurt them, in this
manner must he be slain.</p>

<p>11:6. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of
their prophecy: And they have power over waters, to turn them into blood
and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</p>

<p>11:7. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that
ascendeth out of the abyss shall make war against them and shall
overcome them and kill them.</p>

<p>11:8. And their bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city which
is called spiritually, Sodom and Egypt: where their Lord also was
crucified.</p>

<p>11:9. And they of the tribes and peoples and tongues and nations shall
see their bodies for three days and a half: and they shall not suffer
their bodies to be laid in sepulchres.</p>

<p>11:10. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and
make merry: and shall send gifts one to another, because these two
prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the earth.</p>

<p>11:11. And after three days and a half, the spirit of life from God
entered into them. And they stood upon their feet: and great fear fell
upon them that saw them.</p>

<p>11:12. And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying to them: Come up
hither. And they went up to heaven in a cloud: and their enemies saw
them.</p>

<p>11:13. And at that hour there was made a great earthquake: and the tenth
part of the city fell. And there were slain in the earthquake, names of
men, seven thousand: and the rest were cast into a fear and gave glory
to the God of heaven.</p>

<p>11:14. The second woe is past: and behold the third woe will come
quickly.</p>

<p>11:15. And the seventh angel sounded the trumpet: and there were great
voices in heaven, saying: The kingdom of this world is become our Lord's
and his Christ's, and he shall reign for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>11:16. And the four and twenty ancients who sit on their seats in the
sight of God, fell on their faces and adored God, saying:</p>

<p>11:17. We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who art and who wast
and who art to come: because thou hast taken to thee thy great power,
and thou hast reigned.</p>

<p>11:18. And the nations were angry: and thy wrath is come. And the time
of the dead, that they should be judged and that thou shouldest render
reward to thy servants the prophets and the saints, and to them that
fear thy name, little and great: and shouldest destroy them who have
corrupted the earth.</p>

<p>11:19. And the temple of God was opened in heaven: and the ark of his
testament was seen in his temple. And there were lightnings and voices
and an earthquake and great hail.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 12</p>

<p>The vision of the woman clothed with the sun and of the great dragon her
persecutor.</p>

<p>12:1. And a great sign appeared in heaven: A woman clothed with the sun,
and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.</p>

<p>A woman... The church of God. It may also, by allusion, be applied to
our blessed Lady. The church is clothed with the sun, that is, with
Christ: she hath the moon, that is, the changeable things of the world,
under her feet: and the twelve stars with which she is crowned, are the
twelve apostles: she is in labour and pain, whilst she brings forth her
children, and Christ in them, in the midst of afflictions and
persecutions.</p>

<p>12:2. And being with child, she cried travailing in birth: and was in
pain to be delivered.</p>

<p>12:3. And there was seen another sign in heaven. And behold a great red
dragon, having seven heads and ten horns and on his heads seven diadems.</p>

<p>12:4. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and cast
them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready
to be delivered: that, when she should be delivered, he might devour her
son.</p>

<p>12:5. And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations
with an iron rod. And her son was taken up to God and to his throne.</p>

<p>12:6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place
prepared by God, that there they should feed her, a thousand two hundred
sixty days.</p>

<p>12:7. And there was a great battle in heaven: Michael and his angels
fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought, and his angels.</p>

<p>12:8. And they prevailed not: neither was their place found any more in
heaven.</p>

<p>12:9. And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, who is
called the devil and Satan, who seduceth the whole world. &nbsp;And he was
cast unto the earth: and his angels were thrown down with him.</p>

<p>12:10. And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying: Now is come salvation
and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ:
because the accuser of our brethren is cast forth, who accused them
before our God day and night.</p>

<p>12:11. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of
the testimony: and they loved not their lives unto death.</p>

<p>12:12. Therefore, rejoice, O heavens, and you that dwell therein. &nbsp;Woe
to the earth and to the sea, because the devil is come down unto you,
having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time.</p>

<p>12:13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
persecuted the woman who brought forth the man child.</p>

<p>12:14. And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle,
that she might fly into the desert, unto her place, where she is
nourished for a time and times, and half a time, from the face of the
serpent.</p>

<p>12:15. And the serpent cast out of his mouth, after the woman, water, as
it were a river: that he might cause her to be carried away by the
river.</p>

<p>12:16. And the earth helped the woman: and the earth opened her mouth
and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</p>

<p>12:17. And the dragon was angry against the woman: and went to make war
with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the
testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>12:18. And he stood upon the sand of the sea.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 13</p>

<p>Of the beast with seven heads and of a second beast.</p>

<p>13:1. And I saw a beast coming up out the sea, having seven heads and
ten horns: and upon his horns, ten diadems: and upon his heads, names of
blasphemy.</p>

<p>A beast... This first beast with seven heads and ten horns, is probably
the whole company of infidels, enemies and persecutors of the people of
God, from the beginning to the end of the world. The seven heads are
seven kings, that is, seven principal kingdoms or empires, which have
exercised, or shall exercise, tyrannical power over the people of God;
of these, five were then fallen, viz.: the Egyptian, Assyrian, Chaldean,
Persian, and Grecian monarchies: one was present, viz., the empire of
Rome: and the seventh and chiefest was to come, viz., the great
Antichrist and his empire. The ten horns may be understood of ten lesser
persecutors.</p>

<p>13:2. And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard: and his feet were
as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion. And the
dragon gave him his own strength and great power.</p>

<p>13:3. And I saw one of his heads as it were slain to death: and his
death's wound was healed. And all the earth was in admiration after the
beast.</p>

<p>One of his heads, etc... Some understand this of the mortal wound, which
the idolatry of the Roman empire (signified by the sixth head) received
from Constantine; which was, as it were, healed again by Julian the
Apostate.</p>

<p>13:4. And they adored the dragon which gave power to the beast. &nbsp;And
they adored the beast, saying: Who is like to the beast? &nbsp;And who shall
be able to fight with him?</p>

<p>13:5. And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and
blasphemies: and power was given to him to do, two and forty months.</p>

<p>13:6. And he opened his mouth unto blasphemies against God, to blaspheme
his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven.</p>

<p>His tabernacle, etc... That is, his church and his saints.</p>

<p>13:7. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to
overcome them. And power was given him over every tribe and people and
tongue and nation.</p>

<p>13:8. And all that dwell upon the earth adored him, whose names are not
written in the book of life of the Lamb which was slain from the
beginning of the world.</p>

<p>Slain from the beginning, etc... In the foreknowledge of God; and
inasmuch as all mercy and grace, from the beginning, was given in view
of his death and passion.</p>

<p>13:9. If any man have an ear, let him hear.</p>

<p>13:10. He that shall lead into captivity shall go into captivity: he
that shall kill by the sword must be killed by the sword. &nbsp;Here is the
patience and the faith of the saints.</p>

<p>13:11. And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth: and he had
two horns, like a lamb: and he spoke as a dragon.</p>

<p>Another beast... This second beast with two horns, may be understood of
the heathenish priests and magicians; the principal promoters both of
idolatry and persecution.</p>

<p>13:12. And he executed all the power of the former beast in his sight.
And he caused the earth and them that dwell therein to adore the first
beast, whose wound to death was healed.</p>

<p>13:13. And he did great signs, so that he made also fire to come down
from heaven unto the earth, in the sight of men.</p>

<p>13:14. And he seduced them that dwell on the earth, for the signs which
were given him to do in the sight of the beast: saying to them that
dwell on the earth that they should make the image of the beast which
had the wound by the sword and lived.</p>

<p>13:15. And it was given him to give life to the image of the beast: and
that the image of the beast should speak: and should cause that
whosoever will not adore the image of the beast should be slain.</p>

<p>13:16. And he shall make all, both little and great, rich and poor,
freemen and bondmen, to have a character in their right hand or on their
foreheads:</p>

<p>13:17. And that no man might buy or sell, but he that hath the
character, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</p>

<p>13:18. Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the
number of the beast. For it is the number of a man: and the number of
him is six hundred sixty-six.</p>

<p>Six hundred sixty-six... The numeral letters of his name shall make up
this number.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 14</p>

<p>Of the Lamb and of the virgins that follow him. Of the judgments that
shall fall upon the wicked.</p>

<p>14:1. And I beheld: and lo a Lamb stood upon mount Sion, and with him an
hundred forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father
written on their foreheads.</p>

<p>14:2. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the noise of many waters and
as the voice of great thunder. And the voice which I heard was as the
voice of harpers, harping on their harps.</p>

<p>14:3. And they sung as it were a new canticle, before the throne and
before the four living creatures and the ancients: and no man could say
the canticle, but those hundred forty-four thousand who were purchased
from the earth.</p>

<p>14:4. These are they who were not defiled with women: for they are
virgins. These follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. &nbsp;These were
purchased from among men, the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.</p>

<p>14:5. And in their mouth there was found no lie: for they are without
spot before the throne of God.</p>

<p>14:6. And I saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven, having
the eternal gospel, to preach unto them that sit upon the earth and over
every nation and tribe and tongue and people:</p>

<p>14:7. Saying with a loud voice: Fear the Lord and give him honour,
because the hour of his judgment is come. And adore ye him that made
heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of waters.</p>

<p>14:8. And another angel followed, saying: That great Babylon is fallen,
is fallen; which made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of
her fornication.</p>

<p>Babylon... By Babylon may be very probably signified all the wicked
world in general, which God will punish, and destroy after the short
time of this mortal life: or it may signify every great city wherein
enormous sins and abominations are daily committed; and that when the
measure of its iniquities is full, the punishments due to its crimes are
poured on it. &nbsp;It may also be some city of the description in the text,
that will exist, and be destroyed, as here described, towards the end of
the world.</p>

<p>14:9. And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice: If
any man shall adore the beast and his image and receive his character in
his forehead or in his hand,</p>

<p>14:10. He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
mingled with pure wine in the cup of his wrath: and shall be tormented
with fire and brimstone in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight
of the Lamb.</p>

<p>14:11. And the smoke of their torments, shall ascend up for ever and
ever: neither have they rest day nor night, who have adored the beast
and his image and whoever receiveth the character of his name.</p>

<p>14:12. Here is the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of
God and the faith of Jesus.</p>

<p>14:13. And I heard a voice from heaven, saying to me: Write: Blessed are
the dead who die in the Lord. From henceforth now, saith the Spirit,
that they may rest from their labours. For their works follow them.</p>

<p>Die in the Lord... It is understood of the martyrs who die for the Lord.</p>

<p>14:14. And I saw: and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one
sitting like to the Son of man, having on his head a crown of gold and
in his hand a sharp sickle.</p>

<p>14:15. And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a loud
voice to him that sat upon the cloud: Thrust in thy sickle and reap,
because the hour is come to reap. For the harvest of the earth is ripe.</p>

<p>14:16. And he that sat on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth:
and the earth was reaped.</p>

<p>14:17. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he
also having a sharp sickle.</p>

<p>14:18. And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over
fire. And he cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp sickle,
saying: Thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the
vineyard of the earth, because the grapes thereof are ripe.</p>

<p>14:19. And the angel thrust in his sharp sickle into the earth and
gathered the vineyard of the earth and cast it into the great press of
the wrath of God:</p>

<p>14:20. And the press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of
the press, up to the horses' bridles, for a thousand and six hundred
furlongs.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 15</p>

<p>They that have overcome the beast glorify God. Of the seven angels with
the seven vials.</p>

<p>15:1. And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful: seven
angels having the seven last plagues. For in them is filled up the wrath
of God.</p>

<p>15:2. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them
that had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name,
standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God:</p>

<p>15:3. And singing the canticle of Moses, the servant of God, and the
canticle of the Lamb, saying: Great and wonderful are thy works, O Lord
God Almighty. Just and true are thy ways, O King of ages.</p>

<p>15:4. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and magnify thy name? For thou
only art holy. For all nations shall come and shall adore in thy sight,
because thy judgments are manifest.</p>

<p>15:5. And after these things, I looked: and behold, the temple of the
tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.</p>

<p>15:6. And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven
plagues, clothed with clean and white linen and girt about the breasts
with golden girdles.</p>

<p>15:7. And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels
seven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and
ever.</p>

<p>15:8. And the temple was filled with smoke from the majesty of God and
from his power. And no man was able to enter into the temple, till the
seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 16</p>

<p>The seven vials are poured out. The plagues that ensue.</p>

<p>16:1. And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven
angels: Go and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God upon the
earth.</p>

<p>16:2. And the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth. &nbsp;And
there fell a sore and grievous wound upon men who had the character of
the beast: and upon them that adored the image thereof.</p>

<p>16:3. And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea. And there
came blood as it were of a dead man: and every living soul died in the
sea.</p>

<p>16:4. And the third poured out his vial upon the rivers and the
fountains of waters. And there was made blood.</p>

<p>16:5. And I heard the angel of the waters saying: Thou art just, O Lord,
who art and who wast, the Holy One, because thou hast judged these
things.</p>

<p>16:6. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets: and thou hast
given them blood to drink. For they are worthy.</p>

<p>16:7. And I heard another, from the altar, saying: Yea, O Lord God
Almighty, true and just are thy judgments.</p>

<p>16:8. And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun. And it was
given unto him to afflict men with heat and fire.</p>

<p>16:9. And men were scorched with great heat: and they blasphemed the
name of God, who hath power over these plagues. Neither did they penance
to give him glory.</p>

<p>16:10. And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
beast. And his kingdom became dark: and they gnawed their tongues for
pain.</p>

<p>16:11. And they blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and
wounds: and did not penance for their works.</p>

<p>16:12. And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon that great river
Euphrates and dried up the water thereof, that a way might be prepared
for the kings from the rising of the sun.</p>

<p>16:13. And I saw from the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the
beast and from the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits
like frogs.</p>

<p>16:14. For they are the spirits of devils, working signs: and they go
forth unto the kings of the whole earth, to gather them to battle
against the great day of the Almighty God.</p>

<p>16:15. Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth and
keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</p>

<p>16:16. And he shall gather them together into a place which in Hebrew is
called Armagedon.</p>

<p>Armagedon... That is, the hill of robbers.</p>

<p>16:17. And the seventh angel poured out his vial upon the air. &nbsp;And
there came a great voice out of the temple from the throne, saying: It
is done.</p>

<p>16:18. And there were lightnings and voices and thunders: and there was
a great earthquake, such an one as never had been since men were upon
the earth, such an earthquake, so great.</p>

<p>16:19. And the great city was divided into three parts: and the cities
of the Gentiles fell. And great Babylon came in remembrance before God,
to give her the cup of the wine of the indignation of his wrath.</p>

<p>16:20. And every island fled away: and the mountains were not found.</p>

<p>16:21. And great hail, like a talent, came down from heaven upon men:
and men blasphemed God, for the plague of the hail: because it was
exceeding great.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 17</p>

<p>The description of the great harlot and of the beast upon which she
sits.</p>

<p>17:1. And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven vials and
spoke with me, saying: Come, I will shew thee the condemnation of the
great harlot, who sitteth upon many waters:</p>

<p>17:2. With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication. &nbsp;And
they who inhabit the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her
whoredom.</p>

<p>17:3. And he took me away in spirit into the desert. And I saw a woman
sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy,
having seven heads and ten horns.</p>

<p>17:4. And the woman was clothed round about with purple and scarlet, and
gilt with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in
her hand, full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication.</p>

<p>17:5. And on her forehead a name was written: A mystery: Babylon the
great, the mother of the fornications and the abominations of the earth.</p>

<p>A mystery... That is, a secret; because what follows of the name and
title of the great harlot is to be taken in a mystical sense. Babylon...
Either the city of the devil in general; or, if this place be to be
understood of any particular city, pagan Rome, which then and for three
hundred years persecuted the church; and was the principal seat both of
empire and idolatry.</p>

<p>17:6. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with
the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And I wondered, when I had seen her,
with great admiration.</p>

<p>17:7. And the angel said to me: Why dost thou wonder? I will tell thee
the mystery of the woman and of the beast which carrieth her, which hath
the seven heads and ten horns.</p>

<p>17:8. The beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall come up
out of the bottomless pit and go into destruction. And the inhabitants
on the earth (whose names are not written in the book of life from the
foundation of the world) shall wonder, seeing the beast that was and is
not.</p>

<p>The beast which thou sawest... This beast which supports Babylon, may
signify the power of the devil: which was and is not, being much limited
by the coming of Christ, but shall again exert itself under Antichrist.
The seven heads of this beast are seven mountains or empires,
instruments of his tyranny; of which five were then fallen. (See chap.
13.1, and below, ver. 10.) The beast itself is said to be the eighth,
and is of the seven; because they all act under the devil, and by his
instigation, so that his power is in them all, yet so as to make up, as
it were, an eighth empire, distinct from them all.</p>

<p>17:9. And here is the understanding that hath wisdom. The seven heads
are seven mountains, upon which the woman sitteth: and they are seven
kings.</p>

<p>17:10. Five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come: and when
he is come, he must remain a short time.</p>

<p>17:11. And the beast which was and is not: the same also is the eighth,
and is of the seven, and goeth into destruction.</p>

<p>17:12. And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have not
yet received a kingdom: but shall receive power as kings, one hour after
the beast.</p>

<p>Ten kings... Ten lesser kingdoms, enemies also of the church of Christ:
which, nevertheless, shall be made instruments of the justice of God for
the punishment of Babylon. Some understand this of the Goths, Vandals,
Huns, and other barbarous nations, that destroyed the empire of Rome.</p>

<p>17:13. These have one design: and their strength and power they shall
deliver to the beast.</p>

<p>17:14. These shall fight with the Lamb. And the Lamb shall overcome them
because he is Lord of lords and King of kings: and they that are with
him are called and elect and faithful.</p>

<p>17:15. And he said to me: The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot
sitteth, are peoples and nations and tongues.</p>

<p>17:16. And the ten horns which thou sawest in the beast: These shall
hate the harlot and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her
flesh and shall burn her with fire.</p>

<p>17:17. For God hath given into their hearts to do that which pleaseth
him: that they give their kingdom to the beast, till the words of God be
fulfilled.</p>

<p>17:18. And the woman which thou sawest is the great city which hath
kingdom over the kings of the earth.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 18</p>

<p>The fall of Babylon. Kings and merchants lament over her.</p>

<p>18:1. And after these things, I saw another angel come down from heaven,
having great power: and the earth was enlightened with his glory.</p>

<p>18:2. And he cried out with a strong voice, saying: Babylon the great is
fallen, is fallen: and is become the habitation of devils and the hold
of every unclean spirit and the hold of every unclean and hateful bird:</p>

<p>18:3. Because all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication: and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with
her; And the merchants of the earth have been made rich by the power of
her delicacies.</p>

<p>18:4. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying: Go out from her, my
people; that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not
of her plagues.</p>

<p>18:5. For her sins have reached unto heaven: and the Lord hath
remembered her iniquities.</p>

<p>18:6. Render to her as she also hath rendered to you: and double unto
her double, according to her works. In the cup wherein she hath mingled,
mingle ye double unto her.</p>

<p>18:7. As much as she hath glorified herself and lived in delicacies, so
much torment and sorrow give ye to her. Because she saith in her heart:
I sit a queen and am no widow: and sorrow I shall not see.</p>

<p>18:8. Therefore, shall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning
and famine. And she shall be burnt with the fire: because God is strong,
who shall judge her.</p>

<p>18:9. And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and
lived in delicacies with her, shall weep and bewail themselves over her,
when they shall see the smoke of her burning:</p>

<p>18:10. Standing afar off for fear of her torments, saying: Alas! &nbsp;alas!
that great city, Babylon, that mighty city: for in one hour is thy
judgment come.</p>

<p>18:11. And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her: for
no man shall buy their merchandise any more.</p>

<p>18:12. Merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones: and of pearls
and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet: and all thyine wood: and
all manner of vessels of ivory: and all manner of vessels of precious
stone and of brass and of iron and of marble:</p>

<p>18:13. And cinnamon and odours and ointment and frankincense and wine
and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and
chariots: and slaves and souls of men.</p>

<p>18:14. And the fruits of the desire of thy soul are departed from thee:
and all fat and goodly things are perished from thee. And they shall
find them no more at all.</p>

<p>18:15. The merchants of these things, who were made rich, shall stand
afar off from her, for fear of her torments, weeping and mourning,</p>

<p>18:16. And saying: Alas! alas! that great city, which was clothed with
fine linen and purple and scarlet and was gilt with gold and precious
stones and pearls.</p>

<p>18:17. For in one hour are so great riches come to nought. And every
shipmaster and all that sail into the lake, and mariners, and as many as
work in the sea, stood afar off,</p>

<p>18:18. And cried, seeing the place of her burning, saying: What city is
like to this great city?</p>

<p>18:19. And they cast dust upon their heads and cried, weeping and
mourning, saying: Alas! alas! that great city, wherein all were made
rich, that had ships at sea, by reason of her prices. For, in one hour
she is made desolate.</p>

<p>18:20. Rejoice over her, thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets.
For God hath judged your judgment on her.</p>

<p>18:21. And a mighty angel took up a stone, as it were a great millstone,
and cast it into the sea, saying: With such violence as this, shall
Babylon, that great city, be thrown down and shall be found no more at
all.</p>

<p>18:22. And the voice of harpers and of musicians and of them that play
on the pipe and on the trumpet shall no more be heard at all in thee:
and no craftsman of any art whatsoever shall be found any more at all in
thee: and the sound of the mill shall be heard no more at all in thee:</p>

<p>18:23. And the light of the lamp shall shine no more at all in thee: and
the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard no more at all
in thee. For thy merchants were the great men of the earth: for all
nations have been deceived by thy enchantments.</p>

<p>18:24. And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of
all that were slain upon the earth.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 19</p>

<p>The saints glorify God for his judgments on the great harlot. &nbsp;Christ's
victory over the beast and the kings of the earth.</p>

<p>19:1. After these things, I heard as it were the voice of much people in
heaven, saying: Alleluia. Salvation and glory and power is to our God.</p>

<p>19:2. For true and just are his judgments, who hath judged the great
harlot which corrupted the earth with her fornication and hath revenged
the blood of his servants, at her hands.</p>

<p>19:3. And again they said: Alleluia. And her smoke ascendeth for ever
and ever.</p>

<p>19:4. And the four and twenty ancients and the four living creatures
fell down and adored God that sitteth upon the throne, saying: Amen.
Alleluia.</p>

<p>19:5. And a voice came out from the throne, saying: Give praise to our
God, all ye his servants: and you that fear him, little and great.</p>

<p>19:6. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the
voice of many waters, and as the voice of great thunders, saying:
Alleluia: for the Lord our God, the Almighty, hath reigned.</p>

<p>19:7. Let us be glad and rejoice and give glory to him. For the marriage
of the Lamb is come: and his wife hath prepared herself.</p>

<p>19:8. And it is granted to her that she should clothe herself with fine
linen, glittering and white. For the fine linen are the justifications
of saints.</p>

<p>19:9. And he said to me: Write: Blessed are they that are called to the
marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith to me: These words of God are
true.</p>

<p>19:10. And I fell down before his feet, to adore him. And he saith to
me: See thou do it not. I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren who
have the testimony of Jesus. Adore God. For the testimony of Jesus is
the spirit of prophecy.</p>

<p>I fell down before, etc... St. Augustine (lib. 20, contra Faust, c. 21)
is of opinion, that this angel appeared in so glorious a manner, that
St. John took him to be God; and therefore would have given him divine
honour had not the angel stopped him, by telling him he was but his
fellow servant. St. Gregory (Hom. 8, in Evang.) rather thinks that the
veneration offered by St. John, was not divine honour, or indeed any
other than what might lawfully be given; but was nevertheless refused by
the angel, in consideration of the dignity to which our human nature had
been raised, by the incarnation of the Son of God, and the dignity of
St. John, an apostle, prophet, and martyr.</p>

<p>19:11. And I saw heaven opened: and behold a white horse. And he that
sat upon him was called faithful and true: and with justice doth he
judge and fight.</p>

<p>19:12. And his eyes were as a flame of fire: and on his head were many
diadems. And he had a name written, which no man knoweth but himself.</p>

<p>19:13. And he was clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood. And his
name is called: THE WORD OF GOD.</p>

<p>19:14. And the armies that are in heaven followed him on white horses,
clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</p>

<p>19:15. And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp two-edged sword, that
with it he may strike the nations. And he shall rule them with a rod of
iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of
God the Almighty.</p>

<p>19:16. And he hath on his garment and on his thigh written: KING OF
KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>

<p>19:17. And I saw an angel standing in the sun: and he cried with a loud
voice, saying to all the birds that did fly through the midst of heaven:
Come, gather yourselves together to the great supper of God:</p>

<p>19:18. That you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of tribunes and
the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on
them: and the flesh of all freemen and bondmen and of little and of
great.</p>

<p>19:19. And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies,
gathered together to make war with him that sat upon the horse and with
his army.</p>

<p>19:20. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who
wrought signs before him, wherewith he seduced them who received the
character of the beast and who adored his image. &nbsp;These two were cast
alive into the pool of fire burning with brimstone.</p>

<p>19:21. And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sitteth upon the
horse, which proceedeth out of his mouth: and all the birds were filled
with their flesh.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 20</p>

<p>Satan is bound for a thousand years. The souls of the martyrs reign with
Christ in the first resurrection. The last attempts of Satan against the
church. The last judgment.</p>

<p>20:1. And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.</p>

<p>20:2. And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the
devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.</p>

<p>Bound him, etc... The power of Satan has been very much limited by the
passion of Christ: for a thousand years; that is, for the whole time of
the New Testament; but especially from the time of the destruction of
Babylon or pagan Rome, till the new efforts of Gog and Magog against the
church, towards the end of the world. During which time the souls of the
martyrs and saints live and reign with Christ in heaven, in the first
resurrection, which is that of the soul to the life of glory; as the
second resurrection will be that of the body, at the day of the general
judgment.</p>

<p>20:3. And he cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a
seal upon him, that he should no more seduce the nations till the
thousand years be finished. And after that, he must be loosed a little
time.</p>

<p>20:4. And I saw seats. And they sat upon them: and judgment was given
unto them. And the souls of them that were beheaded for the testimony of
Jesus and for the word of God and who had not adored the beast nor his
image nor received his character on their foreheads or in their hands.
And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</p>

<p>20:5. The rest of the dead lived not, till the thousand years were
finished. This is the first resurrection.</p>

<p>20:6. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection.
In these the second death hath no power. But they shall be priests of
God and of Christ: and shall reign with him a thousand years.</p>

<p>20:7. And when the thousand years shall be finished, Satan shall be
loosed out of his prison and shall go forth and seduce the nations which
are over the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog: and shall gather
them together to battle, the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.</p>

<p>20:8. And they came upon the breadth of the earth and encompassed the
camp of the saints and the beloved city.</p>

<p>20:9. And there cane down fire from God out of heaven and devoured them:
and the devil, who seduced them, was cast into the pool of fire and
brimstone, where both the beast</p>

<p>20:10. And the false prophet shall be tormented day and night for ever
and ever.</p>

<p>20:11. And I saw a great white throne and one sitting upon it, from
whose face the earth and heaven fled away: and there was no place found
for them.</p>

<p>20:12. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing in the presence of
the throne. And the books were opened: and another book was opened,
which was the book of life. And the dead were judged by those things
which were written in the books, according to their works.</p>

<p>20:13. And the sea gave up the dead that were in it: and death and hell
gave up their dead that were in them. And they were judged, every one
according to their works.</p>

<p>20:14. And hell and death were cast into the pool of fire. This is the
second death.</p>

<p>20:15. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
into the pool of fire.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 21</p>

<p>The new Jerusalem described.</p>

<p>21:1. I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the
first earth was gone: and the sea is now no more.</p>

<p>The first heaven and the first earth was gone, being changed, not as to
their substance, but in their qualities.</p>

<p>21:2. And I, John, saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out
of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</p>

<p>21:3. And I heard a great voice from the throne, saying: Behold the
tabernacle of God with men: and he will dwell with them. &nbsp;And they shall
be his people: and God himself with them shall be their God.</p>

<p>21:4. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and death shall
be no more. Nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more, for
the former things are passed away.</p>

<p>21:5. And he that sat on the throne, said: Behold, I make all things
new. And he said to me: Write. For these words are most faithful and
true.</p>

<p>21:6. And he said to me: It is done. I am Alpha and Omega: the Beginning
and the End. To him that thirsteth, I will give of the fountain of the
water of life, freely.</p>

<p>21:7. He that shall overcome shall possess these things. And I will be
his God: and he shall be my son.</p>

<p>21:8. But the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers
and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, they shall
have their portion in the pool burning with fire and brimstone, which is
the second death.</p>

<p>21:9. And there came one of the seven angels, who had the vials full of
the seven last plagues, and spoke with me, saying: Come and I will shew
thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.</p>

<p>21:10. And he took me up in spirit to a great and high mountain: and he
shewed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,</p>

<p>21:11. Having the glory of God, and the light thereof was like to a
precious stone, as to the jasper stone even as crystal.</p>

<p>21:12. And it had a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and in the
gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of
the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>21:13. On the east, three gates: and on the north, three gates: and on
the south, three gates: and on the west, three gates.</p>

<p>21:14. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations: And in them, the
twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb,</p>

<p>21:15. And he that spoke with me had a measure of a reed of gold, to
measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall.</p>

<p>21:16. And the city lieth in a four-square: and the length thereof is as
great as the breadth. And he measured the city with the golden reed for
twelve thousand furlongs: and the length and the height and the breadth
thereof are equal.</p>

<p>21:17. And he measured the wall thereof an hundred forty-four cubits,
the measure of a man, which is of an angel.</p>

<p>The measure of a man, i.e., According to the measure of men, and used by
the angel... This seems to be the true meaning of these words.</p>

<p>21:18. And the building of the wall thereof was of jasper stone: but the
city itself pure gold like to clear glass.</p>

<p>21:19. And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all
manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper: the second,
sapphire: the third; a chalcedony: the fourth, an emerald:</p>

<p>21:20. The fifth, sardonyx: the sixth, sardius: the seventh, chrysolite:
the eighth, beryl: the ninth, a topaz: the tenth, a chrysoprasus: the
eleventh, a jacinth: the twelfth, an amethyst.</p>

<p>21:21. And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, one to each: and every
several gate was of one several pearl. And the street of the city was
pure gold, as it were, transparent glass.</p>

<p>21:22. And I saw no temple therein. For the Lord God Almighty is the
temple thereof, and the Lamb.</p>

<p>21:23. And the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine
in it. For the glory of God hath enlightened it: and the Lamb is the
lamp thereof.</p>

<p>21:24. And the nations shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of
the earth shall bring their glory and honour into it.</p>

<p>21:25. And the gates thereof shall not be shut by day: for there shall
be no night there.</p>

<p>21:26. And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.</p>

<p>21:27. There shall not enter into it any thing defiled or that worketh
abomination or maketh a lie: but they that are written in the book of
life of the Lamb.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Chapter 22</p>

<p>The water and tree of life. The conclusion.</p>

<p>22:1. And he shewed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal,
proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</p>

<p>22:2. In the midst of the street thereof, and on both sides of the
river, was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruits
every month: the leaves of the tree for the healing of the nations.</p>

<p>22:3. And there shall be no curse any more: but the throne of God and of
the Lamb shall be in it. And his servants shall serve him.</p>

<p>22:4. And they shall see his face: and his name shall be on their
foreheads.</p>

<p>22:5. And night shall be no more. And they shall not need the light of
the lamp, nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God shall enlighten
then. And they shall reign for ever and ever.</p>

<p>22:6. And he said to me: These words are most faithful and true. &nbsp;And
the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to shew his
servant the things which must be done shortly.</p>

<p>22:7. And: Behold I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the words
of the prophecy of this book.</p>

<p>22:8. And I, John, who have heard and seen these things. And, after I
had heard and seen, I fell down to adore before the feet of the angel
who shewed me the things.</p>

<p>22:9. And he said to me: See thou do it not. For I am thy fellow
servant, and of thy brethren the prophets and of them that keep the
words of the prophecy of this book. Adore God.</p>

<p>22:10. And he saith to me: Seal not the words of the prophecy of this
book. For the time is at hand.</p>

<p>For the time is at hand... That is, when compared to eternity, all time
and temporal things vanish, and are but of short duration. As to the
time when the chief predictions should come to pass, we have no
certainty, as appears by the different opinions, both of the ancient
fathers and late interpreters. &nbsp;Many think that most things set down
from the 4th chapter to the end, will not be fulfilled till a little
time before the end of the world. Others are of opinion, that a great
part of them, and particularly the fall of the wicked Babylon, happened
at the destruction of paganism, by the destruction of heathen Rome, and
its persecuting heathen emperors. Of these interpretations, see Aleazar,
in his long commentary; see the learned Bossnet, bishop of Meaux, in his
treatise on this Book; and P. Alleman, in his notes on the same
Apocalypse, tom. 12, who in his Preface says, that this, in a great
measure, may be now looked upon as the opinion followed by the learned
men. In fine, others think that St. John's design was in a mystical way,
by metaphors and allegories, to represent the attempts and persecutions
of the wicked against the servants of God, the punishments that should
in a short time fall upon Babylon, that is, upon all the wicked in
general: the eternal happiness and reward, which God had reserved for
the pious inhabitants of Jerusalem, that is, for his faithful servants,
after their short trials and the tribulations of this mortal life. In
the mean time we meet with many profitable instructions and admonitions,
which we may easily enough understand: but we have no certainty when we
apply these predictions to particular events: for as St. Jerome takes
notice, the Apocalypse has as many mysteries as words, or rather
mysteries in every word. Apocalypsis Joannis tot habet Sacramenta quot
verba--parum dixi, in verbis singulis multiplices latent
intelligentiae. Ep. ad Paulin, t. 4. p. 574. &nbsp;Edit. Benedict.</p>

<p>22:11. He that hurteth, let him hurt still: and he that is filthy, let
him be filthy still: and he that is just, let him be justified still:
and he that is holy, let him be sanctified still.</p>

<p>Let him hurt still... It is not an exhortation, or license to go on in
sin; but an intimation, that how far soever the wicked may proceed,
their progress shall quickly end, and then they must expect to meet with
proportionable punishments.</p>

<p>22:12. Behold, I come quickly: and my reward is with me, to render to
every, man according to his works.</p>

<p>22:13. I am Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and
the End.</p>

<p>22:14. Blessed are they that wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb:
that they may have a right to the tree of life and may enter in by the
gates into the city.</p>

<p>22:15. Without are dogs and sorcerers and unchaste and murderers and
servers of idols and every one that loveth and maketh a lie.</p>

<p>22:16. I, Jesus, have sent my angel, to testify to you these things in
the churches. I am the root and stock of David, the bright and morning
star.</p>

<p>22:17. And the spirit and the bride say: Come. And he that heareth, let
him say: Come. And he that thirsteth, let him come. &nbsp;And he that will,
let him take the water of life, freely.</p>

<p>22:18. For I testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy
of this book: If any man shall add to these things, God shall add unto
him the plagues written in this book.</p>

<p>22:19. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this
prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out
of the holy city, and from these things that are written in this book.</p>

<p>22:20. He that giveth testimony of these things, saith: Surely, I come
quickly: Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>22:21. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
