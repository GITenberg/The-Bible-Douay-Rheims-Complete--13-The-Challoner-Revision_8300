<p>THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS</p>

<p>In this Epistle St. Paul comforts those who are now reformed by his
admonitions to them in the former and absolves the incestuous man on
doing penance, whom he had before excommunicated for his crime. Hence he
treats of true penance and of the dignity of the ministers of the New
Testament. He cautions the faithful against false teachers and the
society of infidels. He gives an account of his sufferings and also of
the favours and graces which God hath bestowed on him. This second
Epistle was written in the same year with the first and sent by Titus
from some place in Macedonia.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians Chapter 1</p>

<p>He speaks of his troubles in Asia. His not coming to them was not out of
levity. The constancy and sincerity of his doctrine.</p>

<p>1:1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy
our brother: to the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the
saints that are in all Achaia:</p>

<p>1:2. Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>1:3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father
of mercies and the God of all comfort:</p>

<p>1:4. Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we also may be able
to comfort them who are in all distress, by the exhortation wherewith we
also are exhorted by God.</p>

<p>1:5. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us: so also by Christ
doth our comfort abound.</p>

<p>1:6. Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and
salvation: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation: or
whether we be exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which
worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.</p>

<p>1:7. That our hope for you may be steadfast: knowing that as you are
partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.</p>

<p>1:8. For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, of our tribulation
which came to us in Asia: that we were pressed out of measure above our
strength, so that we were weary even of life.</p>

<p>1:9. But we had in ourselves the answer of death, that we should not
trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead.</p>

<p>1:10. Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers: in
whom we trust that he will yet also deliver us,</p>

<p>1:11. You helping withal in prayer for us. That for this gift obtained
for us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many in our
behalf.</p>

<p>1:12. For our glory is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in
simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but
in the grace of God, we have conversed in this world: and more
abundantly towards you.</p>

<p>1:13. For we write no other things to you than what you have read and
known. And I hope that you shall know unto the end.</p>

<p>1:14. As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory: as you
also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>1:15. And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that
you might have a second grace:</p>

<p>1:16. And to pass by you into Macedonia: and again from Macedonia to
come to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea.</p>

<p>1:17. Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness? Or, the
things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that there
should be with me, It is, and It is not?</p>

<p>1:18. But God is faithful: for our preaching which was to you, was not,
It is, and It is not.</p>

<p>1:19. For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by
us, by me and Sylvanus and Timothy, was not: It is and It is not. But,
It is, was in him.</p>

<p>It is, was in him... There was no inconstancy in the doctrine of the
apostles, sometimes, like modern sectaries, saying, It is, and at other
times saying, It is not. But their doctrine was ever the same, one
uniform yea, in Jesus Christ, one Amen, that is, one truth in him.</p>

<p>1:20. For all the promises of God are in him, It is. Therefore also by
him, amen to God, unto our glory.</p>

<p>1:21. Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ and that hath
anointed us, is God:</p>

<p>1:22. Who also hath sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our
hearts.</p>

<p>1:23. But I call God to witness upon my soul that to spare you, I came
not any more to Corinth: not because we exercise dominion over your
faith: but we are helpers of your joy. For in faith you stand.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians Chapter 2</p>

<p>He grants a pardon to the incestuous man upon his doing penance.</p>

<p>2:1. But I determined this with myself, to come to you again in sorrow.</p>

<p>2:2. For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then that can make me glad,
but the same who is made sorrowful by me?</p>

<p>2:3. And I wrote this same to you: that I may not, when I come, have
sorrow upon sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice: having
confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</p>

<p>2:4. For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you
with many tears: not that you should be made sorrowful: but that you
might know the charity I have more abundantly towards you.</p>

<p>2:5. And if any one have caused grief, he hath not grieved me: but in
part, that I may not burden you all.</p>

<p>2:6. To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient, which is given
by many.</p>

<p>2:7. So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort
him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</p>

<p>2:8. Wherefore, I beseech you that you would confirm your charity
towards him.</p>

<p>2:9. For to this end also did I write, that I may know the experiment of
you, whether you be obedient in all things.</p>

<p>2:10. And to whom you have pardoned any thing, I also. For, what I have
pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in
the person of Christ:</p>

<p>I also... The apostle here granted an indulgence, or pardon, in the
person and by the authority of Christ, to the incestuous Corinthian,
whom before he had put under penance, which pardon consisted in a
releasing of part of the temporal punishment due to his sin.</p>

<p>2:11. That we be not overreached by Satan. For we are not ignorant of
his devices.</p>

<p>2:12. And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door
was opened unto me in the Lord,</p>

<p>2:13. I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother:
but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia.</p>

<p>2:14. Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ
Jesus and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place.</p>

<p>2:15. For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are
saved and in them that perish.</p>

<p>2:16. To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to the others
the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient?</p>

<p>The odour of death, etc... The preaching of the apostle, which by its
fragrant odour, brought many to life, was to others, through their own
fault, the occasion of death; by their wilfully opposing and resisting
that divine call.</p>

<p>2:17. For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God: but with
sincerity: but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians Chapter 3</p>

<p>He needs no commendatory letters. The glory of the ministry of the New
Testament.</p>

<p>3:1. Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need (as some do)
epistles of commendation to you, or from you?</p>

<p>3:2. You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read
by all men:</p>

<p>3:3. Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by
us, and written: not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God: not
in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart.</p>

<p>3:4. And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God.</p>

<p>3:5. Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of
ourselves: but our sufficiency is from God.</p>

<p>3:6. Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in
the letter but in the spirit. For the letter killeth: but the spirit
quickeneth.</p>

<p>The letter... Not rightly understood, and taken without the spirit.</p>

<p>3:7. Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon
stones, was glorious (so that the children of Israel could not
steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance),
which is made void:</p>

<p>3:8. How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory?</p>

<p>3:9. For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the
ministration of justice aboundeth in glory.</p>

<p>3:10. For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified by
reason of the glory that excelleth.</p>

<p>3:11. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which
remaineth is in glory.</p>

<p>3:12. Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence.</p>

<p>3:13. And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of
Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made
void.</p>

<p>3:14. But their senses were made dull. For, until this present day, the
selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken
away (because in Christ it is made void).</p>

<p>3:15. But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon
their heart.</p>

<p>3:16. But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil shall be
taken away.</p>

<p>3:17. Now the Lord is a Spirit. And where the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is liberty.</p>

<p>3:18. But we all, beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are
transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of
the Lord.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians Chapter 4</p>

<p>The sincerity of his preaching. His comfort in his afflictions.</p>

<p>4:1. Therefore seeing we have this ministration, according as we have
obtained mercy, we faint not.</p>

<p>4:2. But we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in
craftiness nor adulterating the word of God: but by manifestation of the
truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience, in the sight of
God.</p>

<p>4:3. And if our gospel be also hid, it is hid to them that are lost,</p>

<p>4:4. In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of
unbelievers, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is
the image of God, should not shine unto them.</p>

<p>4:5. For we preach not ourselves, but Jesus Christ our Lord: and
ourselves your servants through Jesus.</p>

<p>4:6. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath
shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of
God, in the face of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>4:7. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency
may be of the power of God and not of us.</p>

<p>4:8. In all things we suffer tribulation: but are not distressed. &nbsp;We
are straitened: but are not destitute.</p>

<p>4:9. We suffer persecution: but are not forsaken. We are cast down: but
we perish not.</p>

<p>4:10. Always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus, that
the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies.</p>

<p>4:11. For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake:
that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.</p>

<p>4:12. So then death worketh in us: but life in you.</p>

<p>4:13. But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written: I believed,
for which cause I have spoken; we also believe. For which cause we speak
also:</p>

<p>4:14. Knowing that he who raised up Jesus will raise us up also with
Jesus and place us with you.</p>

<p>4:15. For all things are for your sakes: that the grace, abounding
through many, may abound in thanksgiving unto the glory of God.</p>

<p>4:16. For which cause we faint not: but though our outward man is
corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</p>

<p>4:17. For that which is at present momentary and light of our
tribulation worketh for us above measure, exceedingly an eternal weight
of glory.</p>

<p>4:18. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things
which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal: but the
things which are not seen, are eternal.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians Chapter 5</p>

<p>He is willing to leave his earthly mansion to be with the Lord. &nbsp;His
charity to the Corinthians.</p>

<p>5:1. For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved,
that we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in
heaven.</p>

<p>5:2. For in this also we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our
habitation that is from heaven.</p>

<p>5:3. Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked.</p>

<p>5:4. For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being burthened;
because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is
mortal may be swallowed up by life.</p>

<p>5:5. Now he that maketh us for this very thing is God, who hath given us
the pledge of the Spirit,</p>

<p>5:6. Therefore having always confidence, knowing that while we are in
the body we are absent from the Lord.</p>

<p>5:7. (For we walk by faith and not by sight.)</p>

<p>5:8. But we are confident and have a good will to be absent rather from
the body and to be present with the Lord.</p>

<p>5:9. And therefore we labour, whether absent or present, to please him.</p>

<p>5:10. For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ,
that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as
he hath done, whether it be good or evil.</p>

<p>The proper things of the body... In the particular judgment, immediately
after death, the soul is rewarded or punished according to what it has
done in the body.</p>

<p>5:11. Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we use persuasion to men:
but to God we are manifest. And I trust also that in your consciences we
are manifest.</p>

<p>5:12. We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to
glory in our behalf: that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory
in face, and not in heart.</p>

<p>5:13. For whether we be transported in mind, it is to God: or whether we
be sober, it is for you.</p>

<p>5:14. For the charity of Christ presseth us: judging this, that if one
died for all, then all were dead.</p>

<p>5:15. And Christ died for all: that they also who live may not now live
to themselves, but unto him who died for them and rose again.</p>

<p>5:16. Wherefore henceforth, we know no man according to the flesh. &nbsp;And
if we have known Christ according to the flesh: but now we know him so
no longer.</p>

<p>We know no man according to the flesh... That is, we consider not any
man with regard to his nation, family, kindred, or other natural
qualities or advantages; but only with relation to Christ, and according
to the order of divine charity, in God, and for God. The apostle adds,
that even with respect to Christ himself, he now no longer considers him
according to the flesh, by taking a satisfaction in his being his
countryman; his affection being now purified from all such earthly
considerations.</p>

<p>5:17. If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed
away. Behold all things are made new.</p>

<p>5:18. But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by
Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.</p>

<p>5:19. For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself,
not imputing to them their sins. And he hath placed in us the word of
reconciliation.</p>

<p>5:20. For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were exhorting
by us, for Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God.</p>

<p>5:21. Him, who knew no sin, he hath made sin for us: that we might be
made the justice of God in him.</p>

<p>Sin for us... That is, to be a sin offering, a victim for sin.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians Chapter 6</p>

<p>He exhorts them to a correspondence with God's grace and not to
associate with unbelievers.</p>

<p>6:1. And we helping do exhort you that you receive not the grace of God
in vain.</p>

<p>6:2. For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee and in the day
of salvation have I helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time:
behold, now is the day of salvation.</p>

<p>6:3. Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed.</p>

<p>6:4. But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God,
in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses,</p>

<p>6:5. In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in
fastings,</p>

<p>6:6. In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the
Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned,</p>

<p>6:7. In the word of truth, in the power of God: by the armour of justice
on the right hand and on the left:</p>

<p>6:8. By honour and dishonour: by evil report and good report: as
deceivers and yet true: as unknown and yet known:</p>

<p>6:9. As dying and behold we live: as chastised and not killed:</p>

<p>6:10. As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing: as needy, yet enriching many:
as having nothing and possessing all things.</p>

<p>6:11. Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians: our heart is enlarged.</p>

<p>6:12. You are not straitened in us: but in your own bowels you are
straitened.</p>

<p>6:13. But having the same recompense (I speak as to my children): be you
also enlarged.</p>

<p>6:14. Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath
justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?</p>

<p>6:15. And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the
faithful with the unbeliever?</p>

<p>6:16. And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are
the temple of the living God: as God saith: I will dwell in them and
walk among them. And I will be their God: and they shall be my people.</p>

<p>6:17. Wherefore: Go out from among them and be ye separate, saith the
Lord, and touch not the unclean thing:</p>

<p>6:18. And I will receive you. And will be a Father to you: and you shall
be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians Chapter 7</p>

<p>The apostle's affection for the Corinthians. His comfort and joy on
their account.</p>

<p>7:1. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting
sanctification in the fear of God.</p>

<p>7:2. Receive us. We have injured no man: we have corrupted no man: we
have overreached no man.</p>

<p>7:3. I speak not this to your condemnation. For we have said before that
you are in our hearts: to die together and to live together.</p>

<p>7:4. Great is my confidence for you: great is my glorying for you. &nbsp;I am
filled with comfort: I exceedingly abound with joy in all our
tribulation.</p>

<p>7:5. For also, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest:
but we suffered all tribulation. Combats without: fears within.</p>

<p>7:6. But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us by the coming of
Titus.</p>

<p>7:7. And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation wherewith
he was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your mourning, your
zeal for me: so that I rejoiced the more.</p>

<p>7:8. For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent.
And if I did repent, seeing that the same epistle (although but for a
time) did make you sorrowful,</p>

<p>7:9. Now I am glad: not because you were made sorrowful, but because you
were made sorrowful unto penance. For you were made sorrowful according
to God, that you might suffer damage by us in nothing.</p>

<p>7:10. For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance, steadfast
unto salvation: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</p>

<p>7:11. For behold this selfsame thing, that you were made sorrowful
according to God, how great carefulness it worketh in you: yea defence,
yea indignation, yea fear, yea desire, yea zeal, yea revenge. In all
things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter.</p>

<p>7:12. Wherefore although I wrote to you, it was not for his sake that
did the wrong, nor for him that suffered it: but to manifest our
carefulness that we have for you.</p>

<p>7:13. Before God: therefore we were comforted. But in our consolation we
did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of Titus, because his spirit
was refreshed by you all.</p>

<p>7:14. And if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I have not been put
to shame: but as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so also our
boasting that was made to Titus is found a truth.</p>

<p>7:15. And his bowels are more abundantly towards you: remembering the
obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.</p>

<p>7:16. I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians Chapter 8</p>

<p>He exhorts them to contribute bountifully to relieve the poor of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>8:1. Now we make known unto you, brethren, the grace of God that hath
been given in the churches of Macedonia.</p>

<p>8:2. That in much experience of tribulation, they have had abundance of
joy and their very deep poverty hath abounded unto the riches of their
simplicity.</p>

<p>Simplicity... That is, sincere bounty and charity.</p>

<p>8:3. For according to their power (I bear them witness) and beyond their
power, they were willing:</p>

<p>8:4. With much entreaty begging of us the grace and communication of the
ministry that is done toward the saints.</p>

<p>8:5. And not as we hoped: but they gave their own selves, first to the
Lord, then to us by the will of God;</p>

<p>8:6. Insomuch, that we desired Titus, that, as he had begun, so also he
would finish among you this same grace.</p>

<p>8:7. That as in all things you abound in faith and word and knowledge
and all carefulness, moreover also in your charity towards us: so in
this grace also you may abound.</p>

<p>8:8. I speak not as commanding: but by the carefulness of others,
approving also the good disposition of your charity.</p>

<p>8:9. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich he
became poor for your sakes: that through his poverty you might be rich.</p>

<p>8:10. And herein I give my advice: for this is profitable for you who
have begun not only to do but also to be willing, a year ago.</p>

<p>8:11. Now therefore perform ye it also in deed: that as your mind is
forward to be willing, so it may be also to perform, out of that which
you have.</p>

<p>8:12. For if the will be forward, it is accepted according to that which
a man hath: not according to that which he hath not.</p>

<p>8:13. For I mean not that others should be eased and you burdened, but
by an equality.</p>

<p>8:14. In this present time let your abundance supply their want, that
their abundance also may supply your want: that there may be an
equality,</p>

<p>8:15. As it is written: He that had much had nothing over; and he that
had little had no want.</p>

<p>8:16. And thanks be to God, who hath given the same carefulness for you
in the heart of Titus.</p>

<p>8:17. For indeed he accepted the exhortation: but, being more careful,
of his own will he went unto you.</p>

<p>8:18. We have sent also with him the brother whose praise is in the
gospel through all the churches.</p>

<p>8:19. And not that only: but he was also ordained by the churches
companion of our travels, for this grace, which is administered by us,
to the glory of the Lord and our determined will:</p>

<p>8:20. Avoiding this, lest any man should blame us in this abundance
which is administered by us.</p>

<p>8:21. For we forecast what may be good, not only before God but also
before men.</p>

<p>8:22. And we have sent with them our brother also, whom we have often
proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent: with much
confidence in you,</p>

<p>8:23. Either for Titus, who is my companion and fellow labourer towards
you, or our brethren, the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ.</p>

<p>8:24. Wherefore shew ye to them, in the sight of the churches, the
evidence of your charity and of our boasting on your behalf.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians Chapter 9</p>

<p>A further exhortation to almsgiving. The fruits of it.</p>

<p>9:1. For concerning the ministry that is done towards the saints, it is
superfluous for me to write unto you.</p>

<p>9:2. For I know your forward mind: for which I boast of you to the
Macedonians, that Achaia also is ready from the year past. And your
emulation hath provoked very many.</p>

<p>9:3. Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of
concerning you be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said)
you may be ready:</p>

<p>9:4. Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me and find you
unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter.</p>

<p>9:5. Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they
would go to you before and prepare this blessing before promised, to be
ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness.</p>

<p>9:6. Now this I say: He who soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly:
and he who soweth in blessings shall also reap blessings.</p>

<p>9:7. Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness or
of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</p>

<p>9:8. And God is able to make all grace abound in you: that ye always,
having all sufficiently in all things, may abound to every good work,</p>

<p>9:9. As it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the
poor: his justice remaineth for ever.</p>

<p>9:10. And he that ministereth seed to the sower will both give you bread
to eat and will multiply your seed and increase the growth of the fruits
of your justice:</p>

<p>9:11. That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all
simplicity which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.</p>

<p>9:12. Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the
want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the
Lord.</p>

<p>9:13. By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience of
your confession unto the gospel of Christ and for the simplicity of your
communicating unto them and unto all.</p>

<p>9:14. And in their praying for you, being desirous of you, because of
the excellent grace of God in you.</p>

<p>9:15. Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians Chapter 10</p>

<p>To stop the calumny and boasting of false apostles, he set forth the
power of his apostleship.</p>

<p>10:1. Now I Paul, myself beseech you, by the mildness and modesty of
Christ: who in presence indeed am lowly among you, but being absent am
bold toward you.</p>

<p>10:2. But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with
that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold, against some who
reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh.</p>

<p>10:3. For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the
flesh.</p>

<p>10:4. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty to God,
unto the pulling down of fortifications, destroying counsels,</p>

<p>10:5. And every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of
God: and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience
of Christ:</p>

<p>10:6. And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your
obedience shall be fulfilled.</p>

<p>10:7. See the things that are according to outward appearance. If any
man trust to himself, that he is Christ's let him think this again with
himself, that as he is Christ's, so are we also.</p>

<p>10:8. For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the
Lord hath given us unto edification and not for your destruction, I
should not be ashamed.</p>

<p>10:9. But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by
epistles,</p>

<p>10:10. (For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but
his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible):</p>

<p>10:11. Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by
epistles when absent, such also we will be indeed when present.</p>

<p>10:12. For we dare not match or compare ourselves with some that commend
themselves: but we measure ourselves by ourselves and compare ourselves
with ourselves.</p>

<p>10:13. But we will not glory beyond our measure: but according to the
measure of the rule which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach
even unto you.</p>

<p>10:14. For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we reached
not unto you. For we are come as far as to you in the Gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>10:15. Not glorying beyond measure in other men's labours: but having
hope of your increasing faith, to be magnified in you according to our
rule abundantly.</p>

<p>10:16. Yea, unto those places that are beyond you to preach the gospel:
not to glory in another man's rule, in those things that are made ready
to our hand.</p>

<p>10:17. But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</p>

<p>10:18. For not he who commendeth himself is approved: but he, whom God
commendeth.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians Chapter 11</p>

<p>He is forced to commend himself and his labours, lest the Corinthians
should be imposed upon by the false apostles.</p>

<p>11:1. Would to God you could bear with some little of my folly! But do
bear with me.</p>

<p>My folly... So he calls his reciting his own praises, which, commonly
speaking is looked upon as a piece of folly and vanity; though the
apostle was constrained to do it, for the good of the souls committed to
his charge.</p>

<p>11:2. For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God. For I have
espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin
to Christ.</p>

<p>11:3. But I fear lest, as the serpent seduced Eve by his subtilty, so
your minds should be corrupted and fall from the simplicity that is in
Christ.</p>

<p>11:4. For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ, whom we have not
preached; or if you receive another Spirit, whom you have not received;
or another gospel, which you have not received: you might well bear with
him.</p>

<p>11:5. For I suppose that I have done nothing less than the great
apostles.</p>

<p>11:6. For although I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge: but in all
things we have been made manifest to you.</p>

<p>11:7. Or did I commit a fault, humbling myself that you might be
exalted, because I preached unto you the Gospel of God freely?</p>

<p>11:8. I have taken from other churches, receiving wages of them for your
ministry.</p>

<p>11:9. And, when I was present with you and wanted, I was chargeable to
no man: for that which was wanting to me, the brethren supplied who came
from Macedonia. And in all things I have kept myself from being
burthensome to you: and so I will keep myself.</p>

<p>11:10. The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shall not be
broken off in me in the regions of Achaia.</p>

<p>11:11. Wherefore? Because I love you not? God knoweth it.</p>

<p>11:12. But what I do, that I will do: that I may cut off the occasion
from them that desire occasion: that wherein they glory, they may be
found even as we.</p>

<p>11:13. For such false apostles are deceitful workmen, transforming
themselves into the apostles of Christ.</p>

<p>11:14. And no wonder: for Satan himself transformeth himself into an
angel of light.</p>

<p>11:15. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be transformed as
the ministers of justice, whose end shall be according to their works.</p>

<p>11:16. I say again (Let no man think me to be foolish: otherwise take me
as one foolish, that I also may glory a little):</p>

<p>11:17. That which I speak, I speak not according to God: but as it were
in foolishness, in this matter of glorying.</p>

<p>11:18. Seeing that many glory according to the flesh, I will glory also.</p>

<p>11:19. For you gladly suffer the foolish: whereas yourselves are wise.</p>

<p>11:20. For you suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour
you, if a man take from you, if a man be lifted up, if a man strike you
on the face.</p>

<p>11:21. I seek according to dishonour, as if we had been weak in this
part. Wherein if any man dare (I speak foolishly), I dare also.</p>

<p>11:22. They are Hebrews: so am I. They are Israelites: so am I. &nbsp;They
are the seed of Abraham: so am I.</p>

<p>11:23. They are the ministers of Christ (I speak as one less wise): I am
more; in many more labours, in prisons more frequently, in stripes above
measure, in deaths often.</p>

<p>11:24. Of the Jews five times did I receive forty stripes save one.</p>

<p>11:25. Thrice was I beaten with rods: once I was stoned: thrice I
suffered shipwreck: a night and a day I was in the depth of the sea.</p>

<p>11:26. In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers,
in perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in
the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils
from false brethren:</p>

<p>11:27. In labour and painfulness, in much watchings, in hunger and
thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness:</p>

<p>11:28. Besides those things which are without: my daily instance, the
solicitude for all the churches.</p>

<p>My daily instance... The labours that come in, and press upon me every
day.</p>

<p>11:29. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I am not
on fire?</p>

<p>11:30. If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my
infirmity.</p>

<p>11:31. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for
ever, knoweth that I lie not.</p>

<p>11:32. At Damascus, the governor of the nation under Aretas the king,
guarded the city of the Damascenes, to apprehend me.</p>

<p>11:33. And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall: and
so escaped his hands.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians Chapter 12</p>

<p>His raptures and revelations, His being buffeted by Satan. His fear for
the Corinthians.</p>

<p>12:1. If I must glory (it is not expedient indeed) but I will come to
visions and revelations of the Lord.</p>

<p>12:2. I know a man in Christ: above fourteen years ago (whether in the
body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth), such a
one caught up to the third heaven.</p>

<p>12:3. And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I
know not: God knoweth):</p>

<p>12:4. That he was caught up into paradise and heard secret words which
it is not granted to man to utter.</p>

<p>12:5. For such an one I will glory: but for myself I will glory nothing
but in my infirmities.</p>

<p>12:6. For though I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be foolish:
for I will say the truth. But I forbear, lest any man should think of me
above that which he seeth in me, or any thing he heareth from me.</p>

<p>12:7. And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me, there
was given me a sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me.</p>

<p>12:8. For which thing, thrice I besought the Lord that it might depart
from me.</p>

<p>12:9. And he said to me: My grace is sufficient for thee: for power is
made perfect in infirmity. Gladly therefore will I glory in my
infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me.</p>

<p>Power is made perfect... The strength and power of God more perfectly
shines forth in our weakness and infirmity; as the more weak we are of
ourselves, the more illustrious is his grace in supporting us, and
giving us the victory under all trials and conflicts.</p>

<p>12:10. For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches,
in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ. For when I
am weak, then am I powerful.</p>

<p>12:11. I am become foolish. You have compelled me: for I ought to have
been commended by you. For I have no way come short of them that are
above measure apostles, although I be nothing.</p>

<p>12:12. Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you, in all
patience, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds.</p>

<p>12:13. For what is there that you have had less than the other churches
but that I myself was not burthensome to you? Pardon me this injury.</p>

<p>12:14. Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you and I will
not be burthensome unto you. For I seek not the things that are yours,
but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but
the parents for the children.</p>

<p>12:15. But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls:
although loving you more, I be loved less.</p>

<p>12:16. But be it so: I did not burthen you: but being crafty, I caught
you by guile.</p>

<p>12:17. Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you?</p>

<p>12:18. I desired Titus: and I sent with him a brother. Did Titus
overreach you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? Did we not in the
same steps?</p>

<p>12:19. Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak
before God in Christ: but all things, my dearly beloved, for your
edification.</p>

<p>12:20. For I fear lest perhaps, when I come, I shall not find you such
as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest
perhaps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissensions, detractions,
whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among you.</p>

<p>12:21. Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you: and I mourn
many of them that sinned before and have not done penance for the
uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness that they have committed.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians Chapter 13</p>

<p>He threatens the impenitent, to provoke them to penance.</p>

<p>13:1. Behold, this is the third time I am coming to you: In the mouth of
two or three witnesses shall every word stand.</p>

<p>13:2. I have told before and foretell, as present and now absent, to
them that sinned before and to all the rest, that if I come again, I
will not spare.</p>

<p>13:3. Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me, who towards you
is not weak, but is mighty in you?</p>

<p>13:4. For although he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by
the power of God. For we also are weak in him: but we shall live with
him by the power of God towards you.</p>

<p>13:5. Try your own selves if you be in the faith: prove ye yourselves.
Know you not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless
perhaps you be reprobates?</p>

<p>13:6. But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates.</p>

<p>13:7. Now we pray God that you may do no evil, not that we may appear
approved, but that you may do that which is good and that we may be as
reprobates.</p>

<p>Reprobates... that is, without proof, by having no occasion of shewing
our power in punishing you.</p>

<p>13:8. For we can do nothing against the truth: but for the truth.</p>

<p>13:9. For we rejoice that we are weak and you are strong. This also we
pray for, your perfection.</p>

<p>13:10. Therefore I write these things, being absent, that, being
present, I may not deal more severely, according to the power which the
Lord hath given me unto edification and not unto destruction.</p>

<p>13:11. For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take exhortation, be
of one mind, have peace. And the God of grace and of love shall be with
you.</p>

<p>13:12. Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the saints salute you.</p>

<p>13:13. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the charity of God and the
communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
