<p>THE BOOK OF NUMBERS</p>

<p>This fourth Book of Moses is called NUMBERS, because it begins with the
numbering of the people. The Hebrews, from its first words, call it
VAIEDABBER. It contains the transactions of the Israelites from the
second month of the second year after their going out of Egypt, until
the beginning of the eleventh month of the fortieth year; that is, a
history almost of thirty-nine years.</p>

<p>
Numbers Chapter 1</p>

<p>The children of Israel are numbered: the Levites are designed to serve
the tabernacle.</p>

<p>1:1. And the Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai in the

their families, and houses, and the names of every one, as many as are
of the male sex,</p>

<p>1:3. From twenty years old and upwards, of all the men of Israel fit for
war, and you shall number them by their troops, thou and Aaron.</p>

<p>1:33. Forty thousand five hundred.</p>

<p>1:34. Moreover of the sons of Manasses, by the generations and families

<p>1:44. These are they who were numbered by Moses and Aaron, and the

<p>1:45. And the whole number of the children of Israel by their houses and
families, from twenty years old and upward, that were able to go to war,</p>

<p>1:46. Were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty men.</p>

<p>1:47. But the Levites in the tribes of their families were not numbered
with them.</p>

<p>1:48. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>1:49. Number not the tribe of Levi, neither shalt thou put down the sum
of them with the children of Israel:</p>

<p>1:50. But appoint them over the tabernacle of the testimony, and all the
vessels thereof, and whatsoever pertaineth to the ceremonies. They shall
carry the tabernacle and all the furniture thereof: and they shall
minister, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.</p>

<p>1:51. When you are to go forward, the Levites shall take down the
tabernacle: when you are to camp, they shall set it up. What stranger
soever cometh to it, shall be slain.</p>

<p>1:52. And the children of Israel shall camp every man by his troops and
bands and army.</p>

<p>1:53. But the Levites shall pitch their tents round about the
tabernacle, lest there come indignation upon the multitude of the
children of Israel, and they shall keep watch, and guard the tabernacle
of the testimony.</p>

<p>1:54. And the children of Israel did according to all things which the
Lord had commanded Moses.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 2</p>

<p>The order of the tribes in their camp.</p>

<p>2:1. And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:</p>

<p>2:2. All the children of Israel shall camp by their troops, ensigns, and
standards, and the houses of their kindreds, round about the tabernacle
of the covenant.</p>

<p>2:3. On the east Juda shall pitch his tents by the bands of his army:
and the prince of his sons; shall be Nahasson the son of Aminadab.</p>

<p>2:4. And the whole sum of the fighting men of his stock, were seventy-
four thousand six hundred.</p>

<p>2:5. Next unto him they of the tribe of Issachar encamped, whose prince

<p>2:10. In the camp of the sons of Ruben, on the south side, the prince

<p>2:12. Beside him camped they of the tribe of Simeon: whose prince was

<p>2:14. In the tribe of Gad the prince was Eliasaph the son of Duel.</p>

<p>2:15. And the whole army of his righting men that were numbered, were
forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>2:16. All that were reckoned up in the camp of Ruben, were a hundred and
fifty-one thousand four hundred and fifty, by their troops: they shall
march in the second place.</p>

<p>2:17. And the tabernacle of the testimony shall be carried by the
officers of the Levites and their troops. As it shall be set up, so
shall it be taken down. Every one shall march according to their places,
and ranks.</p>

<p>2:18. On the west side shall be the camp of the sons of Ephraim, whose
prince was Elisama the son of Ammiud.</p>

<p>2:19. The whole army of his fighting men, that were numbered, were forty
thousand five hundred.</p>

<p>2:20. And with them the tribe of the sons of Manasses, whose prince was
Gamaliel the son of Phadassur.</p>

<p>2:21. And the whole army of his fighting men, that were numbered, were
thirty-two thousand two hundred.</p>

<p>2:22. In the tribe of the sons of Benjamin the prince was Abidan the son

<p>2:23. And the whole army of fighting men, that were reckoned up, were
thirty-five thousand four hundred.</p>

<p>2:24. All that were numbered in the camp of Ephraim, were a hundred and
eight-thousand one hundred by their troops: they shall march in the

<p>2:25. On the north side camped the sons of Dan: whose prince was Ahiezar
the son of Ammisaddai.</p>

<p>2:26. The whole army of his fighting men, that were numbered, were

<p>2:27. Beside him they of the tribe of Aser pitched their tents: whose

hundred.</p>

<p>2:31. All that were numbered in the camp of Dan, were a hundred and
fifty-seven thousand six hundred: and they shall march last.</p>

<p>2:32. This is the number of the children of Israel, of their army
divided according to the houses of their kindreds and their troops, six
hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>2:33. And the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel:
for so the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>

<p>2:34. And the children of Israel did according to all things that the
Lord had commanded. They camped by their troops, and marched by the
families and houses of their fathers.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 3</p>

<p>The Levites are numbered and their offices distinguished. They are taken
in the place of the firstborn of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>3:1. These are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the
Lord spoke to Moses in mount Sinai.</p>

<p>3:2. And these the names of the sons of Aaron: his firstborn Nadab, then
Abiu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>

<p>3:3. These the names of the sons of Aaron the priests that were
anointed, and whose hands were filled and consecrated, to do the
functions of priesthood.</p>

<p>3:4. Now Nadab and Abiu died, without children, when they offered
strange fire before the Lord, in the desert of Sinai: and Eleazar and
Ithamar performed the priestly office in the presence of Aaron their
father.</p>

<p>3:5. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>3:6. Bring the tribe of Levi, and make them stand in the sight of Aaron
the priest to minister to him, and let them watch,</p>

<p>3:7. And observe whatsoever appertaineth to the service of the multitude
before the tabernacle of the testimony,</p>

<p>3:8. And let them keep the vessels of the tabernacle, serving in the
ministry thereof.</p>

<p>3:9. And thou shalt give the Levites for a gift,</p>

<p>3:10. To Aaron and to his sons, to whom they are delivered by the
children of Israel. But thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons over the
service of priesthood. The stranger that approacheth to minister, shall
be put to death.</p>

<p>3:11. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>3:12. I have taken the Levites from the children of Israel, for every
firstborn that openeth the womb among the children of Israel, and the
Levites shall be mine.</p>

<p>3:13. For every firstborn is mine: since I struck the firstborn in the
land of Egypt: I have sanctified to myself whatsoever is firstborn in
Israel both of man and beast, they are mine: I am the Lord.</p>

<p>3:14. And the Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, saying:</p>

<p>3:15. Number the sons of Levi by the houses of their fathers and their
families, every male from one month and upward.</p>

<p>3:16. Moses numbered them as the Lord had commanded.</p>

<p>3:17. And there were found sons of Levi by their names, Gerson and Caath
Merari.</p>

<p>3:18. The sons of Gerson: Lebni and Semei.</p>

<p>3:19. The sons of Caath: Amram, and Jesaar, Hebron and Oziel:</p>

<p>3:20. The sons of Merari, Moholi and Musi.</p>

<p>3:21. Of Gerson were two families, the Lebnites, and the Semeites:</p>

<p>3:22. Of which were numbered, people of the male sex from one month and
upward, seven thousand five hundred.</p>

<p>3:23. These shall pitch behind the tabernacle on the west,</p>

<p>3:24. Under their prince Eliasaph the son of Lael.</p>

<p>3:25. And their charge shall be in the tabernacle of the covenant:</p>

<p>3:26. The tabernacle itself and the cover thereof, the hanging that is
drawn before the doors of the tabernacle of the covenant, and the
curtains of the court: the hanging also that is hanged in the entry of
the court of the tabernacle, and whatsoever belongeth to the rite of the
altar, the cords of the tabernacle, and all the furniture thereof.</p>

<p>3:27. Of the kindred of Caath come the families of the Amramites and
Jesaarites and Hebronites and Ozielites. These are the families of the
Caathites reckoned up by their names:</p>

<p>3:28. All of the male sex from one month and upward, eight thousand six
hundred: they shall have the guard of the sanctuary,</p>

<p>3:29. And shall camp on the south side.</p>

<p>3:30. And their prince shall be Elisaphan the son of Oziel:</p>

<p>3:31. And they shall keep the ark, and the table and the candlestick,
the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary, wherewith they minister,
and the veil, and all the furniture of this kind.</p>

<p>3:32. And the prince of the princes of the Levites, Eleazar, the son of
Aaron the priest, shall be over them that watch for the guard of the
sanctuary.</p>

<p>3:33. And of Merari are the families of the Moholites, and Musites,
reckoned up by their names:</p>

<p>3:34. All of the male kind from one month and upward, six thousand two
hundred.</p>

<p>3:35. Their prince Suriel the son of Abihaiel: their shall camp on the
north side.</p>

<p>3:36. Under their custody shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the
bars, and the pillars and their sockets, and all things that pertain to
this kind of service:</p>

<p>3:37. And the pillars of the court round about with their sockets, and
the pins with their cords.</p>

<p>3:38. Before the tabernacle of the covenant, that is to say on the east
side shall Moses and Aaron camp, with their sons, having the custody of
the sanctuary, in the midst of the children of Israel. What stranger
soever cometh unto it, shall be put to death.</p>

<p>3:39. All the Levites, that I Moses and Aaron numbered according to the
precept of the Lord, by their f families, of the male kind from one
month and upward, were twenty-two thousand.</p>

<p>3:40. And the Lord said to Moses: Number the firstborn of the male sex
of the children of Israel, from one month and upward, and thou shalt
take the sum of them.</p>

<p>3:41. And thou shalt take the Levites to me for all the firstborn of the
children of Israel, I am the Lord: and their cattle for all the
firstborn of the cattle of the children of Israel:</p>

<p>3:42. Moses reckoned up, as the Lord had commanded, the firstborn of the
children of Israel:</p>

<p>3:43. And the males by their names, from one month and upward, were
twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three.</p>

<p>3:44. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>3:45. Take the Levites for the firstborn of the children of Israel, and
the cattle of the Levites for their cattle, and the Levites shall be
mine. I am the Lord.</p>

<p>3:46. But for the price of the two hundred and seventy-three, of the
firstborn of the children of Israel, that exceed the number of the
Levites,</p>

<p>3:47. Thou shalt take five sicles for every bead, according to the
weight of the sanctuary. A sicle hath twenty obols.</p>

<p>3:48. And thou shalt give the money to Aaron and his sons, the price of
them that are above.</p>

<p>3:49. Moses therefore took the money of them that were above, and whom
they had redeemed from the Levites,</p>

<p>3:50. For the firstborn of the children of Israel, one thousand three
hundred and sixty-five sicles, according to the weight of the sanctuary,</p>

<p>3:51. And gave it to Aaron and his sons according to the word that the
Lord had commanded him.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 4</p>

<p>The age and time of the Levites' service: their offices and burdens.</p>

<p>4:1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, and Aaron, saying:</p>

<p>4:2. Take the sum of the sons of Caath from the midst of the Levites, by
their houses and families.</p>

<p>4:3. From thirty years old and upward, to fifty years old, of all that
go in to stand and to minister in the tabernacle of the covenant.</p>

<p>4:4. This is the service of the sons of Caath:</p>

<p>4:5. When the camp is; to set forward, Aaron and his sons shall go into
the tabernacle of the covenant, and the holy of holies, and shall take
down the veil that hangeth before the door, and shall wrap up the ark of
the testimony in it,</p>

<p>4:6. And shall cover it again with a cover of violet skins, and shall
spread over it a cloth all of violet, and shall put in the bars.</p>

<p>4:7. They shall wrap up also the table of proposition in a cloth of
violet, and shall put with it the censers and little mortars, the cups
and bowls to pour out the libations: the loaves shall be always on it:</p>

<p>4:8. And they shall spread over it a cloth of scarlet, which again they
shall cover with a covering of violet skins, and shall put in the bars.</p>

<p>4:9. They shall take also a cloth of violet wherewith they shall cover
the candlestick with the lamps and tongs thereof and the snuffers and
all the oil vessels, which are necessary for the dressing of the lamps:</p>

<p>4:10. And over all they shall put a cover of violet skins and put in the
bars.</p>

<p>4:11. And they shall wrap up the golden altar also in a cloth of violet,
and shall spread over it a cover of violet skins, and put in the bars.</p>

<p>4:12. All the vessels wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, they
shall wrap up in a cloth of violet, and shall spread over it a cover of
violet skins, and put in the bars.</p>

<p>4:13. They shall cleanse the altar also from the ashes, and shall wrap
it up in a purple cloth,</p>

<p>4:14. And shall put it with all the vessels that they use in the
ministry thereof, that is to say, firepans, fleshhooks and forks,
pothooks and shovels. They shall cover all the vessels of the altar
together with a covering of violet skins, and shall put in the bars.</p>

<p>4:15. And when Aaron and his sons have wrapped up the sanctuary and the
vessels thereof at the removing of the camp, then shall the sons of
Caath enter in to carry the things wrapped up: and they shall not touch
the vessels of the sanctuary, lest they die. These are the burdens of
the sons of Caath: in the tabernacle of the covenant:</p>

<p>4:16. And over them shall be Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, to
whose charge pertaineth the oil to dress the lamps, and the sweet
incense, and the sacrifice, that is always offered, and the oil of
unction, and whatsoever pertaineth to the service of the tabernacle, and
of all the vessels that are in the sanctuary.</p>

<p>4:17. And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:</p>

<p>4:18. Destroy not the people of Caath from the midst of the Levites:</p>

<p>4:19. But do this to them, that they may live, and not die, by touching
the holies of holies. Aaron and his sons shall go in, and they shall
appoint every man his work, and shall divide the burdens that every man
is to carry.</p>

<p>4:20. Let not others by any curiosity see the things that are in the
sanctuary before they be wrapped up, otherwise they shall die.</p>

<p>4:21. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>4:22. Take the sum of the sons of Gerson also by their houses and
families and kindreds.</p>

<p>4:23. From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old. &nbsp;Number
them all that go in and minister in the tabernacle of the covenant.</p>

<p>4:24. This is the office of the family of the Gersonites:</p>

<p>4:25. To carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the roof of the
covenant, the other covering, and the violet covering over all, and the
hanging that hangeth in the entry of the tabernacle of the covenant,</p>

<p>4:26. The curtains of the court, and the veil in the entry that is
before tabernacle. All things that pertain to the altar, the cords and
the vessels of the ministry,</p>

<p>4:27. The sons of Gerson shall carry, by the commandment of Aaron and
his sons: and each man shall know to what burden he must be assigned.</p>

<p>4:28. This is the service of the family of the Gersonites in the
tabernacle of the covenant, and they shall be under the hand of Ithamar
the son of Aaron the priest.</p>

<p>4:29. Thou shalt reckon up the sons of Merari also by the families and
houses of their fathers,</p>

<p>4:30. From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old, all that
go in to the office of their ministry, and to the service of the
covenant of the testimony.</p>

<p>4:31. These are their burdens: They shall carry the boards of the
tabernacle and the bars thereof, the pillars and their sockets,</p>

<p>4:32. The pillars also of the court round about, with their sockets and
pins and cords. They shall receive by account all the vessels and
furniture, and so shall carry them.</p>

<p>4:33. This is the office of the family of the Merarites, and their
ministry in the tabernacle of the covenant: and they shall be under the
hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.</p>

<p>4:34. So Moses and Aaron and the princes of the synagogue reckoned up
the sons of Caath, by their kindreds and the houses of their fathers,</p>

<p>4:35. From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old, all that
go in to the ministry of the tabernacle of the covenant:</p>

<p>4:36. And they were found two thousand seven hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>4:37. This is the number of the people of Caath that go in to the
tabernacle of the covenant: these did Moses and Aaron number according
to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.</p>

<p>4:38. The sons of Gerson also were numbered by the kindreds and houses
of their fathers,</p>

<p>4:39. From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old, all that
go in to minister in the tabernacle of the covenant:</p>

<p>4:40. And they were found two thousand six hundred and thirty.</p>

<p>4:41. This is the people of the Gersonites, whom Moses and Aaron
numbered according to the word of the Lord.</p>

<p>4:42. The sons of Merari also were numbered by the kindreds and houses
of their fathers,</p>

<p>4:43. From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old, all that
go in to fulfil the rites of the tabernacle of the covenant:</p>

<p>4:44. And they were found three thousand two hundred.</p>

<p>4:45. This is the number of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron
reckoned up according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of
Moses.</p>

<p>4:46. All that were reckoned up of the Levites, and whom Moses and Aaron
and the princes of Israel took by name, by the kindreds and houses of
their fathers,</p>

<p>4:47. From thirty years old and upward, until fifty years old, that go
into the ministry of the tabernacle, and to carry the burdens,</p>

<p>4:48. Were in all eight thousand five hundred and eighty.</p>

<p>4:49. Moses reckoned them up according to the word of the Lord, every
one according to their office and burdens, as the Lord had commanded
him.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 5</p>

<p>The unclean are removed out of the camp: confession of sins, and
satisfaction: firstfruits and oblations belonging to the priests: trial
of jealousy.</p>

<p>5:1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>5:2. Command the children of Israel, that they cast out of the camp
every leper, and whosoever hath an issue of seed, or is defiled by the
dead:</p>

<p>5:3. Whether it be man or woman, cast ye them out of the camp, lest they
defile it when I shall dwell with you,</p>

<p>5:4. And the children of Israel did so, and they cast them forth without
the camp, as the Lord had spoken to Moses.</p>

<p>5:5. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>5:6. Say to the children of Israel: When a man or woman shall have
committed any of all the sins that men are wont to commit, and by
negligence shall have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and
offended,</p>

<p>5:7. They shall confess their sin, and restore the principal itself, and
the fifth part over and above, to him against whom they have sinned.</p>

<p>Shall confess... This confession and satisfaction, ordained in the Old
Law, was a figure of the sacrament of penance.</p>

<p>5:8. But if there be no one to receive it, they shall give it to the
Lord, and it shall be the priest's, besides the ram that is offered for
expiation, to be an atoning sacrifice.</p>

<p>5:9. All the firstfruits also, which the children of Israel offer,
belong to the priest:</p>

<p>5:10. And whatsoever is offered into the sanctuary by every one, and is
delivered into the hands of the priest, it shall be his.</p>

<p>5:11. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>5:12. Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The
man whose wife shall have gone astray, and contemning her husband,</p>

<p>5:13. Shall have slept with another man, and her husband cannot discover
it, but the adultery is secret, and cannot be proved by witnesses,
because she was not found in the adultery:</p>

<p>5:14. If the spirit of jealousy stir up the husband against his wife,
who either is defiled, or is charged with false suspicion,</p>

<p>The spirit of jealousy, etc... This ordinance was designed to clear the
innocent, and to prevent jealous husbands from doing mischief to their
wives: as likewise to give all a horror of adultery, by punishing it in
so remarkable a manner.</p>

<p>5:15. He shall bring her to the priest, and shall offer an oblation for
her, the tenth part of a measure of barley meal: he shall not pour oil
thereon, nor put frankincense upon it: because it is a sacrifice of
jealousy, and an oblation searching out adultery.</p>

<p>5:16. The priest therefore shall offer it, and set it before the Lord.</p>

<p>5:17. And he shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and he shall
cast a little earth of the pavement of the tabernacle into it.</p>

<p>5:18. And when the woman shall stand before the Lord, he shall uncover
her head, and shall put on her hands the sacrifice of remembrance, and
the oblation of jealousy: and he himself shall hold the most bitter
waters, whereon he hath heaped curses with execration.</p>

<p>5:19. And he shall adjure her, and shall say: If another man hath not
slept with thee, and if thou be not defiled by forsaking thy husband's
bed, these most bitter waters, on which I have heaped curses, shall not
hurt thee.</p>

<p>5:20. But if thou hast gone aside from thy husband, and art defiled, and
hast lain with another man:</p>

<p>5:21. These curses shall light upon thee: The Lord make thee a curse,
and an example for all among his people: may he make thy thigh to rot,
and may thy belly swell and burst asunder.</p>

<p>5:22. Let the cursed waters enter into thy belly, and may thy womb swell
and thy thigh rot. And the woman shall answer, Amen, amen.</p>

<p>5:23. And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and shall wash
them out with the most bitter waters, upon which he hath heaped the
curses,</p>

<p>5:24. And he shall give them her to drink. And when she hath drunk them
up,</p>

<p>5:25. The priest shall take from her hand the sacrifice of jealousy, and
shall elevate it before the Lord, and shall put it upon the altar: yet
so as first,</p>

<p>5:26. To take a handful of the sacrifice of that which is offered, and
burn it upon the altar: and so give the most bitter waters to the woman
to drink.</p>

<p>5:27. And when she hath drunk them, if she be defiled, and having
despised her husband be guilty of adultery, the malediction shall go
through her, and her belly swelling, her thigh shall rot: and the woman
shall be a curse, and an example to all the people.</p>

<p>5:28. But if she be not defiled, she shall not be hurt, and shall bear
children.</p>

<p>5:29. This is the law of jealousy. If a woman hath gone aside from her
husband, and be defiled,</p>

<p>5:30. And the husband stirred up by the spirit of jealousy bring her
before the Lord, and the priest do to her according to all things that
are here written:</p>

<p>5:31. The husband shall be blameless, and she shall bear her iniquity.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 6</p>

<p>The law of the Nazarites: the form of blessing the people.</p>

<p>6:1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>6:2. Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When a
man, or woman, shall make a vow to be sanctified, and will consecrate
themselves to the Lord:</p>

<p>6:3. They shall abstain from wine, and from every thing that may make a
man drunk. They shall not drink vinegar of wine, or of any other drink,
nor any thing that is pressed out of the grape: nor shall they eat
grapes either fresh or dried.</p>

<p>6:4. All the days that they are consecrated to the Lord by vow: they
shall eat nothing that cometh of the vineyard, from the raisin even to
the kernel.</p>

<p>6:5. All the time of his separation no razor shall pass over his head,
until the day be fulfilled of his consecration to the Lord. He shall be
holy, and shall let the hair of his head grow.</p>

<p>6:6. All the time of his consecration he shall not go in to any dead,</p>

<p>6:7. Neither shall he make himself unclean, even for his father, or for
his mother, or for his brother, or for his sister, when they die,
because the consecration of his God is upon his head.</p>

<p>6:8. All the days of his separation he shall be holy to the Lord.</p>

<p>6:9. But if any man die suddenly before him: the head of his
consecration shall be defiled: and he shall shave it forthwith on the
same day of his purification, and again on the seventh day.</p>

<p>6:10. And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young
pigeons to the priest in the entry of the covenant of the testimony.</p>

<p>6:11. And the priest shall offer one for sin, and the other for a
holocaust, and shall pray for him, for that he hath sinned by the dead:
and he shall sanctify his head that day:</p>

<p>6:12. And shall consecrate to the Lord the days of his separation,
offering a lamb of one year for sin: yet so that the former days be made
void, because his sanctification was profaned.</p>

<p>6:13. This is the law of consecration. When the days which he had
determined by vow shall be expired, he shall bring him to the door of
the tabernacle of the covenant,</p>

<p>6:14. And shall offer his oblation to the Lord: one he lamb of a year
old without blemish for a holocaust, and one ewe lamb of a year old
without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for a
victim of peace offering,</p>

<p>6:15. A basket also of unleavened bread, tempered with oil, and wafers
without leaven anointed with oil, and the libations of each:</p>

<p>6:16. And the priest shall present them before the Lord, and shall offer
both the sin offering and the holocaust.</p>

<p>6:17. But the ram he shall immolate for a sacrifice of peace offering to
the Lord, offering at the same time the basket of unleavened bread, and
the libations that are due by custom.</p>

<p>6:18. Then shall the hair of the consecration of the Nazarite, be shaved
off before the door of the tabernacle of the covenant: and he shall take
his hair, and lay it upon the fire, which is under the sacrifice of the
peace offerings.</p>

<p>6:19. And shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened
cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and he shall deliver
them into the hands of the Nazarite, after his head is shaven.</p>

<p>6:20. And receiving them again from him, he shall elevate them in the
sight of the Lord: and they being sanctified shall belong to the priest,
as the breast, which was commanded to be separated, and the shoulder.
After this the Nazarite may drink wine.</p>

<p>6:21. This is the law of the Nazarite, when he hath vowed his oblation
to the Lord in the time of his consecration, besides those things which
his hand shall find, according to that which he had vowed in his mind,
so shall he do for the fulfilling of his sanctification.</p>

<p>6:22. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>6:23. Say to Aaron and his sons: Thus shall you bless the children of
Israel, and you shall say to them:</p>

<p>6:24. The Lord bless thee, and keep thee.</p>

<p>6:25. The Lord shew his face to thee, and have mercy on thee.</p>

<p>6:26. The Lord turn his countenance to thee, and give thee peace.</p>

<p>6:27. And they shall invoke my name upon the children of Israel, and I
will bless them.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 7</p>

<p>The offerings of the princes at the dedication of the tabernacle. &nbsp;God
speaketh to Moses from the propitiatory.</p>

<p>7:1. And it came to pass in the day that Moses had finished the
tabernacle, and set it up, and had anointed and sanctified it with all
its vessels, the altar likewise and all the vessels thereof,</p>

<p>7:2. The princes of Israel and the heads of the families, in every
tribe, who were the rulers of them who had been numbered, offered</p>

<p>7:3. Their gifts before the Lord, six wagons covered, and twelve oxen.
Two princes offered one wagon, and each one an ox, and they offered them
before the tabernacle.</p>

<p>7:4. And the Lord said to Moses:</p>

<p>7:5. Receive them from them to serve in the ministry of the tabernacle,
and thou shalt deliver them to the Levites according to the order of
their ministry.</p>

<p>7:6. Moses therefore receiving the wagons and the oxen, delivered them
to the Levites.</p>

<p>7:7. Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gerson, according
to their necessity.</p>

<p>7:8. The other four wagons, and eight oxen he gave to the sons of
Merari, according to their offices and service, under the hand of
Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.</p>

<p>7:9. But to the sons of Caath he gave no wagons or oxen: because they
serve in the sanctuary and carry their burdens upon their own shoulders.</p>

<p>7:10. And the princes offered for the dedication of the altar on the day
when it was anointed, their oblation before the altar.</p>

another offer their gifts for the dedication of the altar.</p>

consult the oracle, he heard the voice of one speaking to him from the
propitiatory, that is over the ark between the two cherubims, and from
this place he spoke to him.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 8</p>

<p>
The seven lamps are placed on the golden candlestick, to shine towards
the loaves of proposition: the ordination of the Levites: and to what
age they shall serve in the tabernacle.</p>

<p>8:1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>8:2. Speak to Aaron, and thou shalt say to him: When thou shalt place
the seven lamps, let the candlestick be set up on the south side. Give
orders therefore that the lamps look over against the north, towards the
table of the loaves of proposition, over against that part shall they
give light, towards which the candlestick looketh.</p>

<p>8:3. And Aaron did so, and he put the lamps upon the candlestick, as the
Lord had commanded Moses.</p>

<p>8:4. Now this was the work of the candlestick, it was of beaten gold,
both the shaft in the middle, and all that came out of both sides of the
branches: according to the pattern which the Lord had shewn to Moses, so
he made the candlestick.</p>

<p>8:5. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>8:6. Take the Levites out of the midst of the children of Israel, and
thou shalt purify them,</p>

<p>8:7. According to this rite: Let them be sprinkled with the water of
purification, and let them shave all the hairs of their flesh. And when
they shall have washed their garments, and are cleansed,</p>

<p>Let them be sprinkled with the water of purification... This was the
holy water mixed with the ashes of the red cow, Num. 19., appointed for
purifying all that were unclean. It was a figure of the blood of Christ,
applied to our souls by his holy sacraments.</p>

<p>8:8. They shall take an ox of the herd, and for the offering thereof
fine flour tempered with oil: and thou shalt take another ox of the herd
for a sin offering:</p>

<p>8:9. And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
covenant, calling together all the multitude of the children of Israel:</p>

<p>8:10. And when the Levites are before the Lord, the children of Israel
shall put their hands upon them:</p>

<p>8:11. And Aaron shall offer the Levites, as a gift in the sight of the
Lord from the children of Israel, that they may serve in his ministry.</p>

<p>8:12. The Levites also shall put their hands upon the heads of the oxen,
of which thou shalt sacrifice one for sin, and the other for a holocaust
to the Lord, to pray for them.</p>

<p>8:13. And thou shalt set the Levites in the sight of Aaron and of his,
and shalt consecrate them being offered to the Lord,</p>

<p>8:14. And shalt separate them from the midst of the children of Israel,
to be mine.</p>

<p>8:15. And afterwards they shall enter into the tabernacle of the
covenant, to serve me. And thus shalt thou purify and consecrate them
for an oblation of the Lord: for as a gift they were given me by the
children of Israel.</p>

<p>8:16. I have taken them instead of the firstborn that open every womb in
Israel,</p>

<p>8:17. For all the firstborn of the children of Israel, both of men and
of beasts, are mine. From the day that I slew every firstborn in the
land of Egypt, have I sanctified them to myself:</p>

<p>8:18. And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children
of Israel:</p>

<p>8:19. And have delivered them for a gift to Aaron and his sons out of
the midst of the people, to serve me for Israel in the tabernacle of the
covenant, and to pray for them, lest there should be a plague among the
people, if they should presume to approach unto my sanctuary.</p>

<p>8:20. And Moses and Aaron and all the multitude of the children of
Israel did with the Levites all that the Lord had commanded Moses,</p>

<p>8:21. And they were purified, and washed their garments. And Aaron
lifted them up in the sight of the Lord, and prayed for them,</p>

<p>8:22. That being purified they might go into the tabernacle of the
covenant to do their services before Aaron and his sons. As the Lord had
commanded Moses touching the Levites, so was it done.</p>

<p>8:23. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>8:24. This is the law of the Levites: From twenty-five years old and
upwards, they shall go in to minister in the tabernacle of the covenant.</p>

<p>8:25. And when they shall have accomplished the fiftieth year of their
age, they shall cease to serve:</p>

<p>8:26. And they shall be the ministers of their brethren in the
tabernacle of the covenant, to keep the things that are committed to
their care, but not to do the works. Thus shalt thou order the Levites
touching their charge.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 9</p>

<p>The precept of the pasch is renewed: the unclean and travellers are to
observe it the second month: the camp is guided by the pillar of the
cloud.</p>

<p>9:1. The Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, the second year
after they were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first month,
saying:</p>

<p>9:2. Let the children of Israel make the phase in its due time,</p>

<p>Make the phase... That is, keep the paschal solemnity, and eat the
paschal lamb.</p>

<p>9:3. The fourteenth day of this month in the evening, according to all
the ceremonies and justifications thereof.</p>

<p>9:4. And Moses commanded the children of Israel that they should make
the phase.</p>

<p>9:5. And they made it in its proper time: the fourteenth day of the
month at evening, in mount Sinai. The children of Israel did according
to all things that the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>

<p>9:6. But behold some who were unclean by occasion of the soul of a man,
who could not make the phase on that day, coming to Moses and Aaron,</p>

<p>Behold some who were unclean by occasion of the soul of a man, etc...
That is, by having touched or come near a dead body, out of which the
soul was departed.</p>

<p>9:7. Said to them: We are unclean by occasion of the soul of a man. Why
are we kept back that we may not offer in its season the offering to the
Lord among the children of Israel?</p>

<p>9:8. And Moses answered them: Stay that I may consult the Lord what he
will ordain concerning you.</p>

<p>9:9. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>9:10. Say to the children of Israel: The man that shall be unclean by
occasion of one that is dead, or shall be in a journey afar off in your
nation, let him make the phase to the Lord.</p>

<p>9:11. In the second month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the
evening, they shall eat it with unleavened bread and wild lettuce:</p>

<p>9:12. They shall not leave any thing thereof until morning, nor break a
bone thereof, they shall observe all the ceremonies of the phase.</p>

<p>9:13. But if any man is clean, and was not on a journey, and did not
make the phase, that soul shall be cut off from among his people,
because he offered not sacrifice to the Lord in due season: he shall
bear his sin.</p>

<p>9:14. The sojourner also and the stranger if they be among you, shall
make the phase to the Lord according to the ceremonies and
justifications thereof. The same ordinances shall be with you both for
the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.</p>

<p>9:15. Now on the day that the tabernacle was reared up, a cloud covered
it. But from the evening there was over the tabernacle, as it were, the
appearance of fire until the morning.</p>

<p>9:16. So it was always: by day the cloud covered it, and by night as it
were the appearance of fire.</p>

<p>9:17. And when the cloud that covered the tabernacle was taken up, then
the children of Israel marched forward: and in the place where the cloud
stood still, there they camped.</p>

<p>9:18. At the commandment of the Lord they marched, and at his
commandment they pitched the tabernacle. All the days that the cloud
abode over the tabernacle, they remained in the same place:</p>

<p>9:19. And if it was so that it continued over it a long time, the
children of Israel kept the watches of the Lord, and marched not,</p>

<p>9:20. For as many days soever as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle.
At the commandment of the Lord they pitched their tents, and at his
commandment they took them down.</p>

<p>9:21. If the cloud tarried from evening until morning, and immediately
at break of day left the tabernacle, they marched forward: and if it
departed after a day and a night, they took down their tents.</p>

<p>9:22. But if it remained over the tabernacle for two days or a month or
a longer time, the children of Israel remained in the same place, and
marched not: but immediately as soon as it departed, they removed the
camp.</p>

<p>9:23. By the word of the Lord they pitched their tents, and by his word
they marched: and kept the watches of the Lord according to his
commandment by the hand of Moses.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 10</p>

<p>The silver trumpets and their use. They march from Sinai.</p>

<p>10:1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>10:2. Make thee two trumpets of beaten silver, wherewith thou mayest
call together the multitude when the camp is to be removed.</p>

<p>10:3. And when thou shalt sound the trumpets, all the multitude shall
gather unto thee to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant.</p>

<p>10:4. If thou sound but once, the princes and the heads of the multitude
of Israel shall come to thee.</p>

<p>10:5. But if the sound of the trumpets be longer, and with
interruptions, they that are on the east side, shall first go forward.</p>

<p>10:6. And at the second sounding and like noise of the trumpet, they who
lie on the south side shall take up their tents. And after this manner
shall the rest do, when the trumpets shall sound for a march.</p>

<p>10:7. But when the people is to be gathered together, the sound of the
trumpets shall be plain, and they shall not make a broken sound.</p>

<p>10:8. And the sons of Aaron the priest shall sound the trumpets: and
this shall be an ordinance for ever in your generations.</p>

<p>10:9. If you go forth to war out of your land against the enemies that
fight against you, you shall sound aloud with the trumpets, and there
shall be a remembrance of you before the Lord your God, that you may be
delivered out of the hands of your enemies.</p>

<p>10:10. If at any time you shall have a banquet, and on your festival
days, and on the first days of your months, you shall sound the trumpets
over the holocausts, and the sacrifices of peace offerings, that they
may be to you for a remembrance of your God. I am the Lord your God.</p>

<p>10:11. The second year, in the second month, the twentieth day of the
month, the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle of the covenant.</p>

<p>10:12. And the children of Israel marched by their troops from the
desert of Sinai, and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Pharan.</p>

<p>10:13. And the first went forward according to the commandment of the
Lord by the hand of Moses.</p>

<p>10:14. The sons of Juda by their troops: whose prince was Nahasson the
son of Aminadab.</p>

<p>10:15. In the tribe of the sons of Issachar, the prince was Nathanael
the son of Suar.</p>

<p>10:16. In the tribe of Zabulon, the prince was Eliab the son of Helon.</p>

<p>10:17. And the tabernacle was taken down, and the sons of Gerson and
Merari set forward, bearing it.</p>

<p>10:18. And the sons of Ruben also marched, by their troops and ranks,
whose prince was Helisur the son of Sedeur.</p>

<p>10:19. And in the tribe of Simeon, the prince was Salamiel the son of
Surisaddai.</p>

<p>10:20. And in the tribe of Gad, the prince was Eliasaph the son of Duel.</p>

<p>10:21. Then the Caathites also marched carrying the sanctuary. &nbsp;So long
was the tabernacle carried, till they came to the place of setting it
up.</p>

<p>10:22. The sons of Ephraim also moved their camp by their troops, in
whose army the prince was Elisama the son of Ammiud.</p>

<p>10:23. And in the tribe of the sons of Manasses, the prince was Gamaliel
the son of Phadassur.</p>

<p>10:24. And in the tribe of Benjamin, the prince was Abidan the son of
Gedeon.</p>

<p>10:25. The last of all the camp marched the sons of Dan by their troops,
in whose army the prince was Ahiezer the son of Ammisaddai.</p>

<p>10:26. And in the tribe of the sons of Aser, the prince was Phegiel the
son of Ochran.</p>

<p>10:27. And in the tribe of the sons of Nephtali, the prince was Ahira
the son of Enan.</p>

<p>10:28. This was the order of the camps, and marches of the children of
Israel by their troops, when they set forward.</p>

<p>10:29. And Moses said to Hobab the son of Raguel the Madianite, his
kinsman: We are going towards the place which the Lord will give us:
come with us, that we may do thee good: for the Lord hath promised good
things to Israel.</p>

<p>10:30. But he answered him: I will not go with thee, but I will return
to my country, wherein I was born.</p>

<p>10:31. And he said: Do not leave us: for thou knowest in what places we
should encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be our guide.</p>

<p>10:32. And if thou comest with us, we will give thee what is the best of
the riches which the Lord shall deliver to us.</p>

<p>10:33. So they marched from the mount of the Lord three days' journey,
and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them, for three days
providing a place for the camp.</p>

<p>10:34. The cloud also of the Lord was over them by day when they
marched.</p>

<p>10:35. And when the ark was lifted up, Moses said: Arise, O Lord, and
let thy enemies be scattered, and let them that hate thee, flee from
before thy face.</p>

<p>10:36. And when it was set down, he said: Return, O Lord, to the
multitude of the host of Israel.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 11</p>

<p>The people murmur and are punished with fire. God appointeth seventy
ancients for assistants to Moses. They prophesy. The people have their
fill of flesh, but forthwith many die of the plague.</p>

<p>11:1. In the mean time there arose a murmuring of the people against the
Lord, as it were repining at their fatigue. And when the Lord heard it
he was angry. And the fire of the Lord being kindled against them,
devoured them that were at the uttermost part of the camp.</p>

<p>11:2. And when the people cried to Moses, Moses prayed to the Lord, and
the fire was swallowed up.</p>

<p>11:3. And he called the name of that place, The burning: for that the
fire of the Lord had been kindled against them.</p>

<p>The burning... Hebrew, Taberah.</p>

<p>11:4. For a mixt multitude of people, that came up with them, burned
with desire, sitting and weeping, the children of Israel also being
joined with them, and said: Who shall give us flesh to eat?</p>

<p>A mixt multitude... These were people that came with them out of Egypt,
who were not of the race of Israel; who, by their murmuring, drew also
the children of Israel to murmur: this should teach us the danger of
associating ourselves with the children of Egypt, that is, with the
lovers and admirers of this wicked world.</p>

<p>11:5. We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt free cost: the cucumbers
come into our mind, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and
the garlic.</p>

<p>11:6. Our soul is dry, our eyes behold nothing else but manna.</p>

<p>11:7. Now the manna was like coriander seed, of the colour of bdellium.</p>

<p>Bdellium... Bdellium, according to Pliny, 1.21, c. 9. was of the colour
of a man's nail, white and bright.</p>

<p>11:8. And the people went about, and gathering it, ground it in a mill,
or beat it in a mortar, and boiled it in a pot, and made cakes thereof
of the taste of bread tempered with oil.</p>

<p>11:9. And when the dew fell in the night upon the camp, the manna also
fell with it.</p>

<p>11:10. Now Moses heard the people weeping by their families, every one
at the door of his tent. And the wrath of the Lord was exceedingly
enkindled: to Moses also the thing seemed insupportable.</p>

<p>11:11. And he said to the Lord: Why hast thou afflicted thy servant?
Wherefore do I not find favour before thee? And why hast thou laid the
weight of all this people upon me?</p>

<p>11:12. Have I conceived all this multitude, or begotten them, that thou
shouldst say to me: Carry them in thy bosom as the nurse is wont to
carry the little infant, and bear them into the land, for which thou
hast sworn to their fathers?</p>

<p>11:13. Whence should I have flesh to give to so great a multitude? &nbsp;They
weep against me, saying: Give us flesh that we may eat.</p>

<p>11:14. I am not able alone to bear all this people, because it is too
heavy for me.</p>

<p>11:15. But if it seem unto thee otherwise, I beseech thee to kill me,
and let me find grace in thy eyes, that I be not afflicted with so great
evils.</p>

<p>11:16. And the Lord said to Moses: Gather unto me seventy men of the
ancients of Israel, whom thou knowest to be ancients and masters of the
people: and thou shalt bring them to the door of the tabernacle of the
covenant, and shalt make them stand there with thee,</p>

<p>Seventy men... This was the first institution of the council or senate,
called the Sanhedrin, consisting of seventy or seventy-two senators or
counsellors.</p>

<p>11:17. That I may come down and speak with thee: and I will take of thy
spirit, and will give to them, that they may bear with thee the burden
of the people, and thou mayest not be burthened alone.</p>

<p>11:18. And thou shalt say to the people: Be ye sanctified: to morrow you
shall eat flesh: for I have heard you say: Who will give us flesh to
eat? It was well with us in Egypt. That the Lord may give you flesh, and
you may eat:</p>

<p>11:19. Not for one day, nor two, nor five, nor ten, no nor for twenty.</p>

<p>11:20. But even for a month of days, till it come out at your nostrils,
and become loathsome to you, because you have cast off the Lord, who is
in the midst of you, and have wept before him, saying: Why came we out
of Egypt?</p>

<p>11:21. And Moses said: There are six hundred thousand footmen of this
people, and sayest thou: I will give them flesh to eat a whole month?</p>

<p>11:22. Shall then a multitude of sheep and oxen be killed, that it may
suffice for their food? or shall the fishes of the sea be gathered
together to fill them?</p>

<p>11:23. And the Lord answered him: Is the hand of the Lord unable? Thou
shalt presently see whether my word shall come to pass or no.</p>

<p>11:24. Moses therefore came, and told the people the words of the Lord,
and assembled seventy men of the ancients of Israel, and made them to
stand about the tabernacle.</p>

<p>11:25. And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, taking away
of the spirit that was in Moses, and giving to the seventy men. And when
the spirit had rested on them they prophesied, nor did they cease
afterwards.</p>

<p>11:26. Now there remained in the camp two of the men, of whom one was
called Eldad, and the other Medad, upon whom the spirit rested; for they
also had been enrolled, but were not gone forth to the tabernacle.</p>

<p>11:27. And when they prophesied in the camp, there ran a young man, and
told Moses, saying: Eldad and Medad prophesy in the camp.</p>

<p>11:28. Forthwith Josue the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, and chosen
out of many, said: My lord Moses forbid them.</p>

<p>11:29. But he said: Why hast thou emulation for me? O that all the
people might prophesy, and that the Lord would give them his spirit!</p>

<p>11:30. And Moses returned, with the ancients of Israel, into the camp.</p>

<p>11:31. And a wind going out from the Lord, taking quails up beyond the
sea brought them, and cast them into the camp for the space of one day's
journey, on every side of the camp round about, and they flew in the air
two cubits high above the ground.</p>

<p>11:32. The people therefore rising up all that day, and night, and the
next day, gathered together of quails, he that did least, ten cores: and
they dried them round about the camp.</p>

<p>11:33. As yet the flesh was between their teeth, neither had that kind
of meat failed: when behold the wrath of the Lord being provoked against
the people, struck them with an exceeding great plague.</p>

<p>11:34. And that place was called, The graves of lust: for there they
buried the people that had lusted. And departing from the graves of
lust, they came unto Haseroth, and abode there.</p>

<p>The graves of lust... Or, the sepulchres of concupiscence: so called
from their irregular desire of flesh. In Hebrew, Kibroth. Hattaavah.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 12</p>

<p>Mary and Aaron murmur against Moses, whom God praiseth above other
prophets. Mary being struck with leprosy, Aaron confesseth his fault.
Moses prayeth for her, and after seven days' separation from the camp,
she is restored.</p>

<p>12:1. And Mary and Aaron spoke against Moses, because of his wife the
Ethiopian,</p>

<p>Ethiopian... Sephora the wife of Moses was of Madian, which bordered
upon the land of Chus or Ethiopia: where note, that the Ethiopia here
spoken of is not that of Africa but that of Arabia.</p>

<p>12:2. And they said: Hath the Lord spoken by Moses only? Hath he not
also spoken to us in like manner? And when the Lord heard this,</p>

<p>12:3. (For Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon
earth)</p>

<p>Exceeding meek... Moses being the meekest of men, would not contend for
himself; therefore, God inspired him to write here his own defence: and
the Holy Spirit, whose dictate he wrote, obliged him to declare the
truth, though it was so much to his own praise.</p>

<p>12:4. Immediately he spoke to him, and to Aaron and Mary: Come out you
three only to the tabernacle of the covenant. And when they were come
out,</p>

<p>12:5. The Lord came down in a pillar of the cloud, and stood in the
entry of the tabernacle calling to Aaron and Mary. And when they were
come,</p>

<p>12:6. He said to them: Hear my words: if there be among you a prophet of
the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a
dream.</p>

<p>12:7. But it is not so with my servant Moses who is most faithful in all
my house:</p>

<p>12:8. For I speak to him mouth to mouth: and plainly, and not by riddles
and figures doth he see the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak
ill of my servant Moses?</p>

<p>12:9. And being angry with them he went away:</p>

<p>12:10. The cloud also that was over the tabernacle departed: and behold
Mary appeared white as snow with a leprosy. And when Aaron had looked on
her, and saw her all covered with leprosy,</p>

<p>12:11. He said to Moses: I beseech thee, my lord, lay not upon us this
sin, which we have foolishly committed:</p>

<p>12:12. Let her not be as one dead, and as an abortive that is cast forth
from the mother's womb. Lo, now one half of her flesh is consumed with
the leprosy.</p>

<p>12:13. And Moses cried to the Lord, saying O God, I beseech thee heal
her.</p>

<p>12:14. And the Lord answered him: If her father had spitten upon her
face, ought she not to have been ashamed for seven days at least? Let
her be separated seven days without the camp, and afterwards she shall
be called again.</p>

<p>12:15. Mary therefore was put out of the camp seven days: and the people
moved not from that place until Mary was called again.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 13</p>

<p>The twelve spies are sent to view the land. The relation they make of
it.</p>

<p>13:1. And the people marched from Haseroth, and pitched their tents in
the desert of Pharan.</p>

<p>13:2. And there the Lord spoke to Moses, saying.</p>

<p>13:3. Send men to view the land of Chanaan, which I will give to the
children of Israel, one of every tribe, of the rulers.</p>

<p>13:4. Moses did what the Lord had commanded, sending from the desert of
Pharan, principal men, whose names are these:</p>

<p>13:5. Of the tribe of Ruben, Sammua the son of Zechur.</p>

<p>13:6. Of the tribe of Simeon, Saphat the son of Huri.</p>

<p>13:7. Of the tribe of Juda, Caleb the son of Jephone.</p>

<p>13:8. Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.</p>

<p>13:9. Of the tribe of Ephraim, Osee the son of Nun.</p>

<p>13:10. Of the tribe of Benjamin, Phalti the son of Raphu.</p>

<p>13:11. Of the tribe of Zabulon, Geddiel the son of Sodi.</p>

<p>13:12. Of the tribe of Joseph, of the sceptre of Manasses, Gaddi the son
of Susi.</p>

<p>13:13. Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</p>

<p>13:14. Of the tribe of Aser, Sthur the son of Michael.</p>

<p>13:15. Of the tribe of Nephtali, Nahabi the son of Vapsi.</p>

<p>13:16. Of the tribe of Gad, Guel the son of Machi.</p>

<p>13:17. These are the names of the men, whom Moses sent to view the land:
and he called Osee the son of Nun, Josue.</p>

<p>13:18. And Moses sent them to view the land of Chanaan, and said to
them: Go you up by the south side. And when you shall come to the
mountains,</p>

<p>13:19. View the land, of what sort it is, and the people that are the
inhabitants thereof, whether they be strong or weak: few in number or
many:</p>

<p>13:20. The land itself, whether it be good or bad: what manner of
cities, walled or without walls:</p>

<p>13:21. The ground, fat or barren, woody or without trees. Be of good
courage, and bring us of the fruits of the land. Now it was the time
when the firstripe grapes are fit to be eaten.</p>

<p>13:22. And when they were gone up, they viewed the land from the desert
of Sin, unto Rohob as you enter into Emath.</p>

<p>13:23. And they went up at the south side, and came to Hebron, where
were Achiman and Sisai and Tholmai the sons of Enac. &nbsp;For Hebron was
built seven years before Tanis the city of Egypt.</p>

<p>13:24. And forward as far as the torrent of the cluster of grapes, they
cut off a branch with its cluster of grapes, which two men carried upon
a lever. They took also of the pomegranates and of the figs of that
place:</p>

<p>13:25. Which was called Nehelescol, that is to say, the torrent of the
cluster of grapes, because from thence the children of Israel had
carried a cluster of grapes.</p>

<p>13:26. And they that went to spy out the land returned after forty days,
having gone round all the country,</p>

<p>13:27. And came to Moses and Aaron and to all the assembly of the
children of Israel to the desert of Pharan, which is in Cades. &nbsp;And
speaking to them and to all the multitude, they shewed them the fruits
of the land:</p>

<p>13:28. And they related and said: We came into the land to which thou
sentest us, which in very deed floweth with milk and honey as may be
known by these fruits:</p>

<p>13:29. But it hath very strong inhabitants, and the cities are great and
walled. We saw there the race of Enac.</p>

<p>13:30. Amalec dwelleth in the south, the Hethite and the Jebusite and
the Amorrhite in the mountains: but the Chanaanite abideth by the sea
and near the streams of the Jordan.</p>

<p>13:31. In the mean time Caleb, to still the murmuring of the people that
rose against Moses, said: Let us go up and possess the land, for we
shall be able to conquer it.</p>

<p>13:32. But the others, that had been with him, said: No, we are not able
to go up to this people, because they are stronger than we.</p>

<p>13:33. And they spoke ill of the land, which they had viewed, before the
children of Israel, saying: The land which we have viewed, devoureth its
inhabitants: the people, that we beheld are of a tall stature.</p>

<p>Spoke ill, etc... These men, who by their misrepresentations of the land
of promise, discouraged the Israelites from attempting the conquest of
it, were a figure of worldlings, who, by decrying or misrepresenting
true devotion, discourage Christians from seeking in earnest and
acquiring so great a good, and thereby securing to themselves a happy
eternity.</p>

<p>13:34. There we saw certain monsters of the sons of Enac, of the giant
kind: in comparison of whom, we seemed like locusts.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 14</p>

<p>The people murmur. God threateneth to destroy them. He is appeased by
Moses, yet so as to exclude the murmurers from entering the promised
land. The authors of the sedition are struck dead. The rest going to
fight against the will of God are beaten.</p>

<p>14:1. Therefore the whole multitude crying wept that night.</p>

<p>14:2. And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron,
saying:</p>

<p>14:3. Would God that we had died in Egypt: and would God we may die in
this vast wilderness, and that the Lord may not bring us into this land,
lest we fall by the sword, and our wives and children be led away
captives. Is it not better to return into Egypt?</p>

<p>14:4. And they said one to another: Let us appoint a captain, and let us
return into Egypt.</p>

<p>14:5. And when Moses and Aaron heard this, they fell down flat upon the
ground before the multitude of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>14:6. But Josue the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephone, who
themselves also had viewed the land, rent their garments,</p>

<p>14:7. And said to all the multitude of the children of Israel: The land
which we have gone round is very good:</p>

<p>14:8. If the Lord be favourable, he will bring us into it, and give us a
land flowing with milk and honey.</p>

<p>14:9. Be not rebellious against the Lord: and fear ye not the people of
this land, for we are able to eat them up as bread. All aid is gone from
them: the Lord is with us, fear ye not.</p>

<p>14:10. And when all the multitude cried out, and would have stoned them,
the glory of the Lord appeared over the tabernacle of the covenant to
all the children of Israel.</p>

<p>14:11. And the Lord said to Moses: How long will this people detract me?
how long will they not believe me for all the signs that I have wrought
before them?</p>

<p>14:12. I will strike them therefore with pestilence, and will consume
them: but thee I will make a ruler over a great nation, and a mightier
than this is.</p>

<p>14:13. And Moses said to the Lord: That the Egyptians, from the midst of
whom thou hast brought forth this people,</p>

<p>14:14. And the inhabitants of this land, (who have heard that thou, O
Lord, art among this people, and art seen face to face, and thy cloud
protecteth them, and thou goest before them in a pillar of a cloud by
day, and in a pillar of fire by night,)</p>

<p>14:15. May hear that thou hast killed so great a multitude as it were
one man and may say:</p>

<p>14:16. He could not bring the people into the land for which he had
sworn, therefore did he kill them in the wilderness.</p>

<p>14:17. Let then the strength of the Lord be magnified, as thou hast
sworn, saying:</p>

<p>14:18. The Lord is patient and full of mercy, by taking away iniquity
and wickedness, and leaving no man clear, who visitest the sins of the
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.</p>

<p>Clear... i. e., who deserves punishment.</p>

<p>14:19. Forgive, I beseech thee, the sins of this people, according to
the greatness of thy mercy, as thou hast been merciful to them from
their going out of Egypt unto this place.</p>

<p>14:20. And the Lord said: I have forgiven according to thy word.</p>

<p>14:21. As I live: and the whole earth shall be filled with the glory of
the Lord.</p>

<p>14:22. But yet all the men that have seen my majesty, and the signs that
I have done in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now ten
times, and have not obeyed my voice,</p>

<p>14:23. Shall not see the land for which I swore to their fathers,
neither shall any one of them that hath detracted me behold it.</p>

<p>14:24. My servant Caleb, who being full of another spirit hath followed
me, I will bring into this land which he hath gone round: and his seed
shall possess it.</p>

<p>14:25. For the Amalecite and the Chanaanite dwell in the valleys. &nbsp;To
morrow remove the camp, and return into the wilderness by the way of the
Red Sea.</p>

<p>14:26. And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:</p>

<p>14:27. How long doth this wicked multitude murmur against me? I have
heard the murmurings of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>14:28. Say therefore to them: As I live, saith the Lord: According as
you have spoken in my hearing, so will I do to you.</p>

<p>14:29. In the wilderness shall your carcasses lie. All you that were
numbered from twenty years old and upward, and have murmured against me,</p>

<p>14:30. Shall not enter into the land, over which I lifted up my hand to
make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephone, and Josue the
son of Nun.</p>

<p>14:31. But your children, of whom you said, that they should be a prey
to the enemies, will I bring in: that they may see the land which you
have despised.</p>

<p>14:32. Your carcasses shall lie in the wilderness.</p>

<p>14:33. Your children shall wander in the desert forty years, and shall
bear your fornication, until the carcasses of their fathers be consumed
in the desert,</p>

<p>Shall bear your fornication... That is, shall bear the punishment of
your disloyalty to God, which in the scripture language is here called a
fornication, in a spiritual sense.</p>

<p>14:34. According to the number of the forty days, wherein you viewed the
land: a year shall be counted for a day. And forty years you shall
receive your iniquities, and shall know my revenge:</p>

<p>14:35. For as I have spoken, so will I do to all this wicked multitude,
that hath risen up together against me: in this wilderness shall it
faint away and die.</p>

<p>14:36. Therefore all the men, whom Moses had sent to view the land, and
who at their return had made the whole multitude to murmur against him,
speaking ill of the land that it was naught,</p>

<p>14:37. Died and were struck in the sight of the Lord.</p>

<p>14:38. But Josue the son of Nun, and Caleb had gone to view the land.</p>

<p>14:39. And Moses spoke all these words to all the children of Israel,
and the people mourned exceedingly.</p>

<p>14:40. And behold rising up very early in the morning, they went up to
the top of the mountain, and said: We are ready to go up to the place,
of which the Lord hath spoken: for we have sinned.</p>

<p>14:41. And Moses said to them: Why transgress you the word of the Lord,
which shall not succeed prosperously with you?</p>

<p>14:42. Go not up, for the Lord is not with you: lest you fall before
your enemies.</p>

<p>14:43. The Amalecite and the Chanaanite are before you, and by their
sword you shall fall, because you would not consent to the Lord, neither
will the Lord be with you.</p>

<p>14:44. But they being blinded went up to the top of the mountain. &nbsp;But
the ark of the testament of the Lord and Moses departed not from the
camp.</p>

<p>14:45. And the Amalecite came down, and the Chanaanite that dwelt in the
mountain: and smiting and slaying them pursued them as far as Horma.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 15</p>

<p>Certain laws concerning sacrifices. Sabbath breaking is punished with
death. The law of fringes on their garments.</p>

<p>15:1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>15:2. Speak to the children of Israel and thou shalt say to them: When
you shall be come unto the land of your habitation, which I will give
you,</p>

<p>15:3. And shall make an offering to the Lord, for a holocaust, or a
victim, paying your vows, or voluntarily offering gifts, or in your
solemnities burning a sweet savour unto the Lord, of oxen or of sheep:</p>

<p>15:4. Whosoever immolateth the victim, shall offer a sacrifice of fine
flour, the tenth part of an ephi, tempered with the fourth part of a hin
of oil:</p>

<p>15:5. And he shall give the same measure of wine to pour out in
libations for the holocaust or for the victim. For every lamb,</p>

<p>15:6. And for every ram there shall be a sacrifice of flour of two
tenths, which shall be tempered with the third part of a hin of oil:</p>

<p>15:7. And he shall offer the third part the same measure of wine for the
libation, for a sweet savour to the Lord.</p>

<p>15:8. But when thou offerest a holocaust or sacrifice of oxen, to fulfil
thy vow or for victims of peace offerings,</p>

<p>15:9. Thou shalt give for every ox three tenths of flour tempered with
half a hin of oil,</p>

<p>15:10. And wine for libations of the same measure, for an offering of
most sweet savour to the Lord.</p>

<p>15:11. Thus shalt thou do</p>

<p>15:12. For every ox and ram and lamb and kid.</p>

<p>15:13. Both they that are born in the land, and the strangers</p>

<p>15:14. Shall offer sacrifices after the same rite.</p>

<p>15:15. There shall be all one law and judgment both for you and for them
who are strangers in the land.</p>

<p>15:16. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>15:17. Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:</p>

<p>15:18. When you are come into the land which I will give you,</p>

<p>15:19. And shall eat of the bread of that country, you shall separate
firstfruits to the Lord,</p>

<p>15:20. Of the things you eat. As you separate firstfruits of your
barnfloors:</p>

<p>15:21. So also shall you give firstfruits of your dough to the Lord.</p>

<p>15:22. And if through ignorance you omit any of these things, which the
Lord hath spoken to Moses,</p>

<p>15:23. And by him hath commanded you from the day that he began to
command and thenceforward,</p>

<p>15:24. And the multitude have forgotten to do it: they shall offer a
calf out of the herd, a holocaust for a most sweet savour to the Lord,
and the sacrifice and libations thereof, as the ceremonies require, and
a buck goat for sin:</p>

<p>15:25. And the priest shall pray for all the multitude of the children
of Israel: and it shall be forgiven them, because they sinned
ignorantly, offering notwithstanding a burnt offering to the Lord for
themselves and for their sin and their Ignorance:</p>

<p>15:26. And it shall be forgiven all the people of the children of
Israel: and the strangers that sojourn among them: because it is the
fault of all the people through ignorance.</p>

<p>15:27. But if one soul shall sin ignorantly, he shall offer a she goat
of a year old for his sin.</p>

<p>15:28. And the priest shall pray for him, because he sinned ignorantly
before the Lord: and he shall obtain his pardon, and it shall be
forgiven him.</p>

<p>15:29. The same law shall be for all that sin by ignorance, whether they
be natives or strangers.</p>

<p>15:30. But the soul that committeth any thing through pride, whether he
be born in the land or a stranger (because he hath been rebellious
against the Lord) shall be cut off from among his people:</p>

<p>15:31. For he hath contemned the word of the Lord, and made void his
precept: therefore shall he be destroyed, and shall bear his iniquity.</p>

<p>15:32. And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were in the
wilderness, and had found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day,</p>

<p>15:33. That they brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole multitude.</p>

<p>15:34. And they put him into prison, not knowing what they should do
with him.</p>

<p>15:35. And the Lord said to Moses: Let that man die, let all the
multitude stone him without the camp.</p>

<p>15:36. And when they had brought him out, they stoned him, and he died
as the Lord had commanded.</p>

<p>15:37. The Lord also said to Moses:</p>

<p>15:38. Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt tell them to make
to themselves fringes in the corners of their garments, putting in them
ribands of blue:</p>

<p>Fringes... The Pharisees enlarged these fringes through hypocrisy, Matt.
23.5, to appear more zealous than other men for the law of God.</p>

<p>15:39. That when they shall see them, they may remember all the
commandments of the Lord, and not follow their own thoughts and eyes
going astray after divers things,</p>

<p>15:40. But rather being mindful of the precepts of the Lord, may do them
and be holy to their God.</p>

<p>15:41. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
that I might be your God.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 16</p>

<p>The schism of Core and his adherents: their punishment.</p>

<p>16:1. And behold Core the son of Isaar, the son of Caath, the son of
Levi, and Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab, and Hon the son of
Pheleth of the children of Ruben,</p>

<p>16:2. Rose up against Moses, and with them two hundred and fifty others
of the children of Israel, leading men of the synagogue, and who in the
time of assembly were called by name.</p>

<p>Rose up... The crime of these men, which was punished in so remarkable a
manner, was that of schism, and of rebellion against the authority
established by God in the church; and their pretending to the priesthood
without being lawfully called and sent: the same is the case of all
modern sectaries.</p>

<p>16:3. And when they had stood up against Moses and Aaron, they said: Let
it be enough for you, that all the multitude consisteth of holy ones,
and the Lord is among them: Why lift you up yourselves above the people
of the Lord?</p>

<p>16:4. When Moses heard this, he fell flat on his face:</p>

<p>16:5. And speaking to Core and all the multitude, he said: In the
morning the Lord will make known who belong to him, and the holy he will
join to himself: and whom he shall choose, they shall approach to him.</p>

<p>16:6. Do this therefore: Take every man of you your censers, thou Core,
and all thy company.</p>

<p>16:7. And putting fire in them to morrow, put incense upon it before the
Lord: and whomsoever he shall choose, the same shall be holy: you take
too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.</p>

<p>16:8. And he said again to Core: Hear ye sons of Levi.</p>

<p>16:9. Is it a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath spared
you from all the people, and joined you to himself, that you should
serve him in the service of the tabernacle, and should stand before the
congregation of the people, and should minister to him?</p>

<p>16:10. Did he therefore make thee and all thy brethren the sons of Levi
to approach unto him, that you should challenge to yourselves the
priesthood also,</p>

<p>16:11. And that all thy company should stand against the Lord? &nbsp;for what
is Aaron that you murmur against him?</p>

<p>16:12. Then Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab. But
they answered: We will not come.</p>

<p>16:13. Is it a small matter to thee, that thou hast brought us out of a
land that flowed with milk and honey, to kill us in the desert, except
thou rule also like a lord over us?</p>

<p>16:14. Thou hast brought us indeed into a land that floweth with rivers
of milk and honey, and hast given us possessions of fields and
vineyards; wilt thou also pull out our eyes? We will not come.</p>

<p>16:15. Moses therefore being very angry, said to the Lord: Respect not
their sacrifices: thou knowest that I have not taken of them so much as
a young ass at any time, nor have injured any of them.</p>

<p>Very angry... This anger was a zeal against sin; and an indignation at
the affront offered to God; like that which the same holy prophet
conceived upon the sight of the golden calf, Ex. 32.19.</p>

<p>16:16. And he said to Core: Do thou and thy congregation stand apart
before the Lord to morrow, and Aaron apart.</p>

<p>16:17. Take every one of you censers, and put incense upon them,
offering to the Lord two hundred and fifty censers: let Aaron also hold
his censer.</p>

<p>16:18. When they had done this, Moses and Aaron standing,</p>

<p>16:19. And had drawn up all the multitude against them to the door of
the tabernacle, the glory of the Lord appeared to them all.</p>

<p>16:20. And the Lord speaking to Moses and Aaron, said:</p>

<p>16:21. Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may
presently destroy them.</p>

<p>16:22. They fell flat on their face, and said: O most mighty, the God of
the spirits of all flesh, for one man's sin shall thy wrath rage against
all?</p>

<p>16:23. And the Lord said to Moses:</p>

<p>16:24. Command the whole people to separate themselves from the tents of
Core and Dathan and Abiron.</p>

<p>16:25. And Moses arose, and went to Dathan and Abiron: and the ancients
of Israel following him,</p>

<p>16:26. He said to the multitude: Depart from the tents of these wicked
men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be involved in their sins.</p>

<p>16:27. And when they were departed from their tents round about, Dathan
and Abiron coming out stood in the entry of their pavilions with their
wives and children, and all the people.</p>

<p>16:28. And Moses said: By this you shall know that the Lord hath sent me
to do all things that you see, and that I have not forged them of my own
head:</p>

<p>16:29. If these men die the common death of men, and if they be visited
with a plague, wherewith others also are wont to be visited, the Lord
did not send me.</p>

<p>16:30. But if the Lord do a new thing, and the earth opening her mouth
swallow them down, and all things that belong to them, and they go down
alive into hell, you shall know that they have blasphemed the Lord.</p>

<p>16:31. And immediately as he had made an end of speaking, the earth
broke asunder under their feet:</p>

<p>16:32. And opening her mouth, devoured them with their tents and all
their substance.</p>

<p>16:33. And they went down alive into hell, the ground closing upon them,
and they perished from among the people.</p>

<p>16:34. But all Israel, that was standing round about, fled at the cry of
them that were perishing: saying: Lest perhaps the earth swallow us up
also.</p>

<p>16:35. And a fire coming out from the Lord, destroyed the two hundred
and fifty men that offered the incense.</p>

<p>16:36. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>16:37. Command Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the
censers that lie in the burning, and to scatter the fire of one side and
the other: because they are sanctified</p>

<p>16:38. In the deaths of the sinners: and let him beat them into plates,
and fasten them to the altar, because incense hath been offered in them
to the Lord, and they are sanctified, that the children of Israel may
see them for a sign and a memorial.</p>

<p>16:39. Then Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherein they had
offered, whom the burning fire had devoured, and beat them into plates,
fastening them to the altar:</p>

<p>16:40. That the children of Israel might have for the time to come
wherewith they should be admonished, that no stranger or any one that is
not of the seed of Aaron should come near to offer incense to the Lord,
lest he should suffer as Core suffered, and all his congregation,
according as the Lord spoke to Moses.</p>

<p>16:41. The following day all the multitude of the children of Israel
murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying: You have killed the people of
the Lord.</p>

<p>16:42. And when there arose a sedition, and the tumult increased,</p>

<p>16:43. Moses and Aaron fled to the tabernacle of the covenant. &nbsp;And when
they were gone into it, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord
appeared.</p>

<p>16:44. And the Lord said to Moses:</p>

<p>16:45. Get you out from the midst of this multitude, this moment will I
destroy them. And as they were lying on the ground,</p>

<p>16:46. Moses said to Aaron: Take the censer, and putting fire in it from
the altar, put incense upon it, and go quickly to the people to pray for
them: for already wrath is gone out from the Lord, and the plague
rageth.</p>

<p>16:47. When Aaron had done this, and had run to the midst of the
multitude which the burning fire was now destroying, he offered the
incense:</p>

<p>16:48. And standing between the dead and the living, he prayed for the
people, and the plague ceased.</p>

<p>16:49. And the number of them that were slain was fourteen thousand and
seven hundred men, besides them that had perished in the sedition of
Core.</p>

<p>16:50. And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of the
covenant after the destruction was over.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 17</p>

<p>The priesthood is confirmed to Aaron by the miracle of the blooming of
his rod, which is kept for a monument in the tabernacle.</p>

<p>17:1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>17:2. Speak to the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a
rod by their kindreds, of all the princes of the tribes, twelve rods,
and write the name of every man upon his rod.</p>

<p>17:3. And the name of Aaron shall be for the tribe of Levi, and one rod
shall contain all their families:</p>

<p>17:4. And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the covenant
before the testimony, where I will speak to thee.</p>

<p>17:5. Whomsoever of these I shall choose, his rod shall blossom: and I
will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel,
wherewith they murmur against you.</p>

<p>17:6. And Moses spoke to the children of Israel: and all the princes
gave him rods one for every tribe: and there were twelve rods besides
the rod of Aaron.</p>

<p>17:7. And when Moses had Laid them up before the Lord in the tabernacle
of the testimony:</p>

<p>17:8. He returned on the following day, and found that the rod of Aaron
for the house of Levi, was budded: and that the buds swelling it hid
bloomed blossoms, which spreading the leaves, were formed into almonds.</p>

<p>The rod of Aaron for the house of Levi, was budded, etc... This rod of
Aaron which thus miraculously brought forth fruit, was a figure of the
blessed Virgin conceiving and bringing forth her Son without any
prejudice to her virginity.</p>

<p>17:9. Moses therefore brought out all the rods from before the Lord to
all the children of Israel: and they saw, and every one received their
rods.</p>

<p>17:10. And the Lord said to Moses: Carry back the rod of Aaron into the
tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be kept there for a token of
the rebellious children of Israel, and that their complaints may cease
from me lest they die.</p>

<p>17:11. And Moses did as the Lord had commanded.</p>

<p>17:12. And the children of Israel said to Moses: Behold we are consumed,
we all perish.</p>

<p>17:13. Whosoever approacheth to the tabernacle of the Lord, he dieth.
Are we all to a man to be utterly destroyed?</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 18</p>

<p>The charge of the priests and of the Levites, and their portion.</p>

<p>18:1. And the Lord said to Aaron: Thou, and thy sons, and thy father's
house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and
thy sons with thee shall bear the sins of your priesthood.</p>

<p>Thou, and thy father's house with thee, shall bear the iniquity of the
sanctuary... That is, you shall be punished if, through negligence or
want of due attention, you err in the discharge of the sacred functions
for which you were ordained.</p>

<p>18:2. And take with thee thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, and the
sceptre of thy father, and let them be ready in hand, and minister to
thee: but thou and thy sons shall minister in the tabernacle of the
testimony.</p>

<p>18:3. And the Levites shall watch to do thy commands, and about all the
works of the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of
the sanctuary nor the altar, lest both they die, and you also perish
with them.</p>

<p>18:4. But let them be with thee, and watch in the charge of the
tabernacle, and in all the ceremonies thereof. A stranger shall not join
himself with you.</p>

<p>18:5. Watch ye in the charge of the sanctuary, and in the ministry of
the altar: lest indignation rise upon the children of Israel.</p>

<p>18:6. I have given you your brethren the Levites from among the children
of Israel, and have delivered them for a gift to the Lord, to serve in
the ministries of the tabernacle.</p>

<p>18:7. But thou and thy sons look ye to the priesthood: and all things
that pertain to the service of the altar, and that are within the veil,
shall be executed by the priests. If any stranger shall approach, he
shall be slain.</p>

<p>18:8. And the Lord said to Aaron: Behold I have given thee the charge of
my firstfruits. All things that are sanctified by the children of
Israel, I have delivered to thee and to thy sons for the priestly
office, by everlasting ordinances.</p>

<p>18:9. These therefore shalt thou take of the things that are sanctified,
and are offered to the Lord. Every offering, and sacrifice, and
whatsoever is rendered to me for sin and for trespass, and becometh holy
of holies, shall be for thee and thy sons.</p>

<p>18:10. Thou shalt eat it in the sanctuary: the males only shall eat
thereof, because it is a consecrated thing to thee.</p>

<p>18:11. But the firstfruits, which the children of Israel shall vow and
offer, I have given to thee, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters, by a
perpetual law. He that is clean in thy house, shall eat them.</p>

<p>18:12. All the best of the oil, and of the wine, and of the corn,
whatsoever firstfruits they offer to the Lord, I have given them to
thee.</p>

<p>18:13. All the firstripe of the fruits, that the ground bringeth forth,
and which are brought to the Lord, shall be for thy use: he that is
clean in thy house, shall eat them.</p>

<p>18:14. Every thing that the children of Israel shall give by vow, shall
be thine.</p>

<p>18:15. Whatsoever is firstborn of all flesh, which they offer to the
Lord, whether it be of men, or of beasts, shall belong to thee: only for
the firstborn of man thou shalt take a price, and every beast that is
unclean thou shalt cause to be redeemed,</p>

<p>18:16. And the redemption of it shall be after one month, for five
sicles of silver, by the weight of the sanctuary. A sicle hath twenty
obols.</p>

<p>18:17. But the firstling of a cow, and of a sheep and of a goat thou
shalt not cause to be redeemed, because they are sanctified to the Lord.
Their blood only thou shalt pour upon the altar, and their fat thou
shalt burn for a most sweet odour to the Lord.</p>

<p>18:18. But the flesh shall fall to thy use, as the consecrated breast,
and the right shoulder shall be thine.</p>

<p>18:19. All the firstfruits of the sanctuary which the children of Israel
offer to the Lord, I have given to thee and to thy sons and daughters,
by a perpetual ordinance. It is a covenant of salt for ever before the
Lord, to thee and to thy sons.</p>

<p>A covenant of salt... It is a proverbial expression, signifying a
covenant not to be altered or corrupted; as salt is used to keep things
from corruption; a covenant perpetual, like that by which it was
appointed, that salt should be used in every sacrifice. Lev. 2.</p>

<p>18:20. And the Lord said to Aaron: You shall possess nothing in their
land, neither shall you have a portion among them: I am thy portion and
inheritance in the midst of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>18:21. And I have given to the sons of Levi all the tithes of Israel for
a possession, for the ministry wherewith they serve me in the tabernacle
of the covenant:</p>

<p>18:22. That the children of Israel may not approach any more to the
tabernacle, nor commit deadly sin,</p>

<p>Deadly sin... That is, sin which will bring death after it.</p>

<p>18:23. But only the sons of Levi may serve me in the tabernacle, and
bear the sins of the people. It shall be an everlasting ordinance in
your generations. They shall not possess any other thing,</p>

<p>18:24. But be content with the oblation or tithes, which I have
separated for their uses and necessities.</p>

<p>18:25. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>18:26. Command the Levites, and declare unto them: When you shall
receive of the children of Israel the tithes, which I have given you,
offer the firstfruits of them to the Lord, that is to say, the tenth
part of the tenth:</p>

<p>18:27. That it may be reckoned to you as an oblation of firstfruits, as
well of the barnfloors as of the winepresses:</p>

<p>18:28. And of all the things of which you receive tithes, offer the
firstfruits to the Lord, and give them to Aaron the priest.</p>

<p>18:29. All the things that you shall offer of the tithes, and shall
separate for the gifts of the Lord, shall be the best and choicest
things.</p>

<p>18:30. And thou shalt say to them: If you offer all the goodly and the
better things of the tithes, it shall be reckoned to you as if you had
given the firstfruits of the barnfloor and the winepress:</p>

<p>18:31. And you shall eat them in all your places, both you and your
families: because it is your reward for the ministry, wherewith you
serve in the tabernacle of the testimony.</p>

<p>18:32. And you shall not sin in this point, by reserving the choicest
and fat things to yourselves, lest you profane the oblations of the
children of Israel, and die.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 19</p>

<p>The law of the sacrifice of the red cow, and the water of expiation.</p>

<p>19:1. And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:</p>

<p>19:2. This is the observance of the victim, which the Lord hath
ordained. Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee a
red cow of full age, in which there is no blemish, and which hath not
carried the yoke:</p>

<p>A red cow, etc... This red cow, offered in sacrifice for sin, and
consumed with fire without the camp, with the ashes of which, mingled
with water, the unclean were to be expiated and purified; was a figure
of the passion of Christ, by whose precious blood applied to our souls
in the holy sacraments, we are cleansed from our sins.</p>

<p>19:3. And you shall deliver her to Eleazar the priest, who shall bring
her forth without the camp, and shall immolate her in the sight of all:</p>

<p>19:4. And dipping his finger in her blood, shall sprinkle it over
against the door of the tabernacle seven times,</p>

<p>19:5. And shall burn her in the sight of all delivering up to the fire
her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, and her dung.</p>

<p>19:6. The priest shall also take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet
twice dyed, and cast it into the flame, with which the cow is consumed.</p>

<p>19:7. And then after washing his garments, and body, he shall enter into
the camp, and shall be unclean until the evening.</p>

<p>19:8. He also that hath burned her, shall wash his garments, and his
body, and shall be unclean until the evening.</p>

<p>19:9. And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the cow, and
shall pour them forth without the camp in a most clean place, that they
may be reserved for the multitude of the children of Israel, and for a
water of aspersion: because the cow was burnt for sin.</p>

<p>19:10. And when he that carried the ashes of the cow, hath washed his
garments, he shall be unclean until the evening. The children of Israel,
and the strangers that dwell among them, shall observe this for a holy
thing by a perpetual ordinance.</p>

<p>19:11. He that toucheth the corpse of a man, and is therefore unclean
seven days,</p>

<p>19:12. Shall be sprinkled with this water on the third day, and on the
seventh, and so shall be cleansed. If he were not sprinkled on the third
day, he cannot be cleansed on the seventh.</p>

<p>19:13. Every one that toucheth the corpse of a man, and is not sprinkled
with this mixture, shall profane the tabernacle of the Lord, and shall
perish out of Israel: because he was not sprinkled with the water of
expiation, he shall be unclean, and his uncleanness shall remain upon
him.</p>

<p>19:14. This is the law of a man that dieth in a tent: All that go into
his tent and all the vessels that are there, shall be unclean seven
days.</p>

<p>19:15. The vessel that hath no cover, nor binding over it, shall be
unclean.</p>

<p>19:16. If any man in the field touch the corpse of a man that was slain,
or that died of himself, or his bone, or his grave, he shall be unclean
seven days.</p>

<p>19:17. And they shall take of the ashes of the burning and of the sin
offering, and shall pour living waters upon them into a vessel.</p>

<p>19:18. And a man that is clean shall dip hyssop in them, and shall
sprinkle therewith all the tent, and all the furniture, and the men that
are defiled with touching any such thing:</p>

<p>19:19. And in this manner he that is clean shall purify the unclean on
the third and on the seventh day. And being expiated the seventh day, he
shall wash both himself and his garments, and be unclean until the
evening.</p>

<p>19:20. If any man be not expiated after this rite, his soul shall perish
out of the midst of the church: because he hath profaned the sanctuary
of the Lord, and was not sprinkled with the water of purification.</p>

<p>19:21. This precept shall be an ordinance for ever. He also that
sprinkled the water, shall wash his garments. Every one that shall touch
the waters of expiation, shall be unclean until the evening.</p>

<p>19:22. Whatsoever a person toucheth who is unclean, he shall make it
unclean: and the person that toucheth any of these things, shall be
unclean until the evening.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 20</p>

<p>The death of Mary the sister of Moses. The people murmur for want of
water: God giveth it them from the rock. The death of Aaron.</p>

<p>20:1. And the children of Israel, and all the multitude came into the
desert of Sin, in the first month: and the people abode in Cades. And
Mary died there, and was buried in the same place.</p>

<p>20:2. And the people wanting water, came together against Moses and
Aaron:</p>

<p>20:3. And making a sedition, they said: Would God we had perished among
our brethren before the Lord.</p>

<p>20:4. Why have you brought out the church of the Lord into the
wilderness, that both we and our cattle should die?</p>

<p>20:5. Why have you made us come up out of Egypt, and have brought us
into this wretched place which cannot be sowed, nor bringeth forth figs,
nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is there any water to drink?</p>

<p>20:6. And Moses and Aaron leaving the multitude, went into the
tabernacle of the covenant, and fell flat upon the ground, and cried to
the Lord, and said. O Lord God, hear the cry of this people, and open to
them thy treasure, a fountain of living water, that being satisfied,
they may cease to murmur. And the glory of the Lord appeared over them.</p>

<p>20:7. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>20:8. Take the rod, and assemble the people together, thou and Aaron thy
brother, and speak to the rock before them, and it shall yield waters.
And when thou hast brought forth water out of the rock, all the
multitude and their cattle shall drink.</p>

<p>20:9. Moses therefore took the rod, which was before the Lord, as he had
commanded him,</p>

<p>20:10. And having gathered together the multitude before the rock, he
said to them: Hear, ye rebellious and incredulous: Can we bring you
forth water out of this rock?</p>

<p>20:11. And when Moses bad lifted up his hand, and struck the rock twice
with the rod, there came forth water in great abundance, so that the
people and their cattle drank,</p>

<p>The rock... This rock was a figure of Christ, and the water that issued
out from the rock, of his precious blood, the source of all our good.</p>

<p>20:12. And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: Because you have not
believed me, to sanctify me before the children of Israel, you shall not
bring these people into the land, which I will give them.</p>

<p>You have not believed, etc... The fault of Moses and Aaron, on this
occasion, was a certain diffidence and weakness of faith; not doubting
of God's power or veracity; but apprehending the unworthiness of that
rebellious and incredulous people, and therefore speaking with some
ambiguity.</p>

<p>20:13. This is the Water of contradiction, where the children of Israel
strove with words against the Lord, and he was sanctified in them.</p>

<p>The Water of contradiction... Or strife. Hebrew, Meribah.</p>

<p>20:14. In the mean time Moses sent messengers from Cades to the king of
Edom, to say: Thus saith thy brother Israel: Thou knowest all the labour
that hath come upon us:</p>

<p>20:15. In what manner our fathers went down into Egypt, and there we
dwelt a long time, and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers.</p>

<p>20:16. And how we cried to the Lord, and he heard us, and sent an angel,
who hath brought us out of Egypt. Lo, we are now in the city of Cades,
which is in the uttermost of thy borders,</p>

<p>20:17. And we beseech thee that we may have leave to pass through thy
country. We will not go through the fields, nor through the vineyards,
we will not drink the waters of thy wells, but we will go by the common
highway, neither turning aside to the right hand, nor to the left, till
we are past thy borders.</p>

<p>20:18. And Edom answered them: Thou shalt not pass by me: if thou dost I
will come out armed against thee.</p>

<p>20:19. And the children of Israel said: We will go by the beaten way:
and if we and our cattle drink of thy waters, we will give thee what is
just: there shall be no difficulty in the price, only let us pass
speedily.</p>

<p>20:20. But he answered: Thou shalt not pass. And immediately he came
forth to meet them with an infinite multitude, and a strong hand,</p>

<p>20:21. Neither would he condescend to their desire to grant them passage
through his borders. Wherefore Israel turned another way from him.</p>

<p>20:22. And when they had removed the camp from Cades, they came to mount
Hor, which is in the borders of the land of Edom:</p>

<p>20:23. Where the Lord spoke to Moses:</p>

<p>20:24. Let Aaron, saith he, go to his people: for he shall not go into
the land which I have given the children of Israel, because he was
incredulous to my words, at the waters of contradiction.</p>

<p>20:25. Take Aaron and his son with him, and bring them up into mount
Hor:</p>

<p>20:26. And when thou hast stripped the father of his vesture, thou shalt
vest therewith Eleazar his son: Aaron shall be gathered to his people,
and die there.</p>

<p>20:27. Moses did as the Lord had commanded: and they went up into mount
Hor before all the multitude.</p>

<p>20:28. And when he had stripped Aaron of his vestments, he vested
Eleazar his son with them.</p>

<p>20:29. And Aaron being dead in the top of the mountain, he came down
with Eleazar.</p>

<p>20:30. And all the multitude seeing that Aaron was dead, mourned for him
thirty days throughout all their families.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 21</p>

<p>King Arad is overcome. The people murmur and are punished with fiery
serpents: they are healed by the brazen serpent. They conquer the kings
Sehon and Og.</p>

<p>21:1. And when king Arad the Chanaanite, who dwelt towards the south,
had heard this, to wit, that Israel was come by the way of the spies, he
fought against them, and overcoming them carried off their spoils.</p>

<p>21:2. But Israel binding himself by vow to the Lord, said: If thou wilt
deliver thus people into my hand, I will utterly destroy their cities.</p>

<p>21:3. And the Lord heard the prayers of Israel, and delivered up the
Chanaanite, and they cut them off and destroyed their cities: and they
called the name of that place Horma, that is to say, Anathema.</p>

<p>Anathema... That is, a thing devoted to utter destruction.</p>

<p>21:4. And they marched from mount Hor, by the way that leadeth to the
Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom. And the people began to be weary
of their journey and labour:</p>

<p>21:5. And speaking against God and Moses, they said: Why didst thou
bring us out of Egypt, to die in the wilderness? There is no bread, nor
have we any waters: our soul now loatheth this very light food.</p>

<p>Very light food... So they call the heavenly manna: thus worldlings
loathe the things of heaven, for which they have no relish.</p>

<p>21:6. Wherefore the Lord sent among the people fiery serpents, which bit
them and killed many of them.</p>

<p>Fiery serpents... They are so called, because they that were bitten by
them were burnt with a violent heat.</p>

<p>21:7. Upon which they came to Moses, and said; We have sinned, because
we have spoken against the Lord and thee: pray that he may take away
these serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.</p>

<p>21:8. And the Lord said to him: Make a brazen serpent, and set it up for
a sign: whosoever being struck shall look on it, shall live.</p>

<p>21:9. Moses therefore made a brazen serpent, and set it up for a sign:
which when they that were bitten looked upon, they were healed.</p>

<p>A brazen serpent... This was a figure of Christ crucified, and of the
efficacy of a lively faith in him, against the bites of the hellish
serpent. John 3.14.</p>

<p>21:10. And the children of Israel setting forwards camped in Oboth.</p>

<p>21:11. And departing thence they pitched their tents in Jeabarim, in the
wilderness, that faceth Moab toward the east.</p>

<p>21:12. And removing from thence, they came to the torrent Zared:</p>

<p>21:13. Which they left and encamped over against Arnon, which is in the
desert and standeth out on the borders of the Amorrhite. &nbsp;For Arnon is
the border of Moab, dividing the Moabites and the Amorrhites.</p>

<p>21:14. Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord: As he
did in the Red Sea, so will he do in the streams of Arnon.</p>

<p>The book of the wars, etc... An ancient book, which, like several others
quoted in scripture, has been lost.</p>

<p>21:15. The rocks of the torrents were bowed down that they might rest in
Ar, and lie down in the borders of the Moabites.</p>

<p>21:16. When they went from that place, the well appeared whereof the
Lord said to Moses: Gather the people together, and I will give them
water.</p>

<p>21:17. Then Israel sung this song: Let the well spring up. They sung
thereto:</p>

<p>21:18. The well, which the princes dug, and the chiefs of the people
prepared by the direction of the lawgiver, and with their staves. And
they marched from the wilderness to Mathana.</p>

<p>21:19. From Mathana unto Nahaliel: from Nahaliel unto Bamoth.</p>

<p>21:20. From Bamoth, is a valley in the country of Moab, to the top of
Phasga, which looked towards the desert.</p>

<p>21:21. And Israel sent messengers to Sehon king of the Amorrhites,
saying:</p>

<p>21:22. I beseech thee that I may have leave to pass through thy land: we
will not go aside into the fields or the vineyards, we will not drink
waters of the wells, we will go the king's highway, till we be past thy
borders.</p>

<p>21:23. And he would not grant that Israel should pass by his borders:
but rather gathering an army, went forth to meet them in the desert, and
came to Jasa and fought against them.</p>

<p>21:24. And he was slain by them with the edge of the sword, and they
possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jeboc, and to the confines of
the children of Ammon: for the borders of the Ammonites, were kept with
a strong garrison.</p>

<p>21:25. So Israel took all his cities, and dwelt in the cities of the
Amorrhite, to wit, in Hesebon, and in the villages thereof.</p>

<p>21:26. Hesebon was the city of Sehon the king of the Amorrhites, who
fought against the king of Moab: and took all the land, that had been of
his dominion, as far as the Arnon.</p>

<p>21:27. Therefore it is said in the proverb: Come into Hesebon, let the
city of Sehon be built and set up:</p>

<p>21:28. A fire is gone out of Hesebon, a flame from the city of Sehon,
and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites, and the inhabitants of the high
places of the Arnon.</p>

<p>21:29. Woe to thee Moab: thou art undone, O people of Chamos. &nbsp;He hath
given his sons to flight, and his daughters into captivity to Sehon the
king of the Amorrhites.</p>

<p>21:30. Their yoke is perished from Hesebon unto Dibon, they came weary
to Nophe, and unto Medaba.</p>

<p>21:31. So Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorrhite.</p>

<p>21:32. And Moses sent some to take a view of Jazer: and they took the
villages of it, and conquered the inhabitants.</p>

<p>21:33. And they turned themselves, and went up by the way of Basan, and
Og the king of Basan came against them with all his people, to fight in
Edrai.</p>

<p>21:34. And the Lord said to Moses: Fear him not, for I have delivered
him and all his people, and his country into thy hand: and thou shalt do
to him as thou didst to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites, the inhabitant
of Hesebon.</p>

<p>21:35. So they slew him also with his sons, and all his people, not
letting any one escape, and they possessed his land.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 22</p>

<p>Balac, king of Moab, sendeth twice for Balaam to curse Israel. In his
way Balaam is rebuked by an angel.</p>

<p>22:1. And they went forward and encamped in the plains of Moab, over
against where Jericho is situate beyond the Jordan.</p>

<p>22:2. And Balac the son of Sephor, seeing all that Israel had done to
the Amorrhite,</p>

<p>22:3. And that the Moabites were in great fear of him, and were not able
to sustain his assault,</p>

<p>22:4. He said to the elders of Madian: So will this people destroy all
that dwell in our borders, as the ox is wont to eat the grass to the
very roots. Now he was at that time king in Moab.</p>

<p>22:5. He sent therefore messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, a
soothsayer, who dwelt by the river of the land of the children of Ammon,
to call him, and to say: Behold a people is come out of Egypt, that hath
covered the face of the earth, sitting over against me.</p>

<p>22:6. Come therefore, and curse this people, because it is mightier than
I: if by any means I may beat them and drive them out of my land: for I
know that he whom thou shalt bless is blessed, and he whom thou shalt
curse is cursed.</p>

<p>22:7. And the ancients of Moab, and the elders of Madian, went with the
price of divination in their hands. And where they were come to Balaam,
and had told him all the words of Balac:</p>

<p>22:8. He answered: Tarry here this night and I will answer whatsoever
the Lord shall say to me. And while they stayed with Balaam, God came
and said to him:</p>

<p>22:9. What mean these men that are with thee?</p>

<p>22:10. He answered: Balac the son of Sephor king of the Moabites hath
sent to me,</p>

<p>22:11. Saying: Behold a people that is come out of Egypt, hath covered
the face of the land: come and curse them, if by any means I may fight
with them and drive them away.</p>

<p>22:12. And God said to Balaam: Thou shalt not go with them, nor shalt
thou curse the people: because it is blessed.</p>

<p>22:13. And he rose in the morning and said to the princes: Go into your
country, because the Lord hath forbid me to come with you.</p>

<p>22:14. The princes returning, said to Balac: Balaam would not come with
us.</p>

<p>22:15. Then he sent many more and more noble than he had sent before:</p>

<p>22:16. Who, when they were come to Balaam, said: Thus saith Balac the
son of Sephor, Delay not to come to me:</p>

<p>22:17. For I am ready to honour thee, and will give thee whatsoever thou
wilt: come and curse this people.</p>

<p>22:18. Balaam answered: If Balac would give me his house full of silver
and gold, I cannot alter the word of the Lord my God, to speak either
more or less.</p>

<p>22:19. I pray you to stay here this night also, that I may know what the
Lord will answer me once more.</p>

<p>To stay... His desiring them to stay, after he had been fully informed
already that it was not God's will he should go, came from the
inclination he had to gratify Balac, for the sake of worldly gain. And
this perverse disposition God punished by permitting him to go (though
not to curse the people as he would willingly have done), and suffering
him to fall still deeper and deeper into sin, till he came at last to
give that abominable counsel against the people of God, which ended in
his own destruction. So sad a thing it is to indulge a passion for
money.</p>

<p>22:20. God therefore came to Balaam in the night, and said to him: If
these men be come to call thee, arise and go with them: yet so, that
thou do what I shall command thee.</p>

<p>22:21. Balaam arose in the morning, and saddling his ass went with them.</p>

<p>22:22. And God was angry. And an angel of the Lord stood in the way
against Balaam, who sat on the ass, and had two servants with him.</p>

<p>22:23. The ass seeing the angel standing in the way, with a drawn sword,
turned herself out of the way, and went into the field. And when Balaam
beat her, and had a mind to bring her again to the way,</p>

<p>22:24. The angel stood in a narrow place between two walls, wherewith
the vineyards were enclosed.</p>

<p>22:25. And the ass seeing him, thrust herself close to the wall, and
bruised the foot of the rider. But he beat her again:</p>

<p>22:26. And nevertheless the angel going on to a narrow place, where
there was no way to turn aside either to the right hand or to the left,
stood to meet him.</p>

<p>22:27. And when the ass saw the angel standing, she fell under the feet
of the rider: who being angry beat her sides more vehemently with a
staff.</p>

<p>22:28. And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said: What have
I done to thee? Why strikest thou me, lo, now this third time?</p>

<p>Opened the mouth, etc... The angel moved the tongue of the ass, to utter
these speeches, to rebuke, by the mouth of a brute beast, the brutal
fury and folly of Balaam.</p>

<p>22:29. Balaam answered: Because thou hast deserved it, and hast served
me ill: I would I had a sword that I might kill thee.</p>

<p>22:30. The ass said: Am not I thy beast, on which thou hast been always
accustomed to ride until this present day? tell me if I ever did the
like thing to thee. But he said: Never.</p>

<p>22:31. Forthwith the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the
angel standing in the way with a drawn sword, and he worshipped him
falling flat on the ground.</p>

<p>22:32. And the angel said to him: Why beatest thou thy ass these three
times? I am come to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse, and
contrary to me:</p>

<p>Perverse... Because thy inclinations are wicked in being willing for the
sake of gain to curse the people of whom I am the guardian.</p>

<p>22:33. And unless the ass had turned out of the way, giving place to me
who stood against thee, I had slain thee, and she should have lived.</p>

<p>22:34. Balaam said: I have sinned, not knowing that thou didst stand
against me: and now if it displease thee that I go, I will return.</p>

<p>22:35. The angel said: Go with these men, and see thou speak no other
thing than what I shall command thee. He went therefore with the
princes.</p>

<p>22:36. And when Balac heard it he came forth to meet him in a town of
the Moabites, that is situate in the uttermost borders of Arnon.</p>

<p>22:37. And he said to Balaam: I sent messengers to call thee, why didst
thou not come immediately to me? was it because I am not able to reward
thy coming?</p>

<p>22:38. He answered him: Lo, here I am: shall I have power to speak any
other thing but that which God shall put in my mouth?</p>

<p>22:39. So they went on together, and came into a city, that was in the
uttermost borders of his kingdom.</p>

<p>22:40. And when Balac had killed oxen and sheep, he sent presents to
Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.</p>

<p>22:41. And when morning was come, he brought him to the high places of
Baal, and he beheld the uttermost part of the people.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 23</p>

<p>Balaam, instead of cursing Israel, is obliged to bless them, and
prophesy good things of them.</p>

<p>23:1. And Balaam said to Balac: Build me here seven altars, and prepare
as many calves, and the same number of rams.</p>

<p>23:2. And when he had done according to the word of Balaam, they laid
together a calf and a ram upon every altar.</p>

<p>23:3. And Balaam said to Balac: Stand a while by thy burnt offering,
until I go, to see if perhaps the Lord will meet me, and whatsoever he
shall command, I will speak to thee.</p>

<p>23:4. And when he was gone with speed, God met him. And Balaam speaking
to him, said: I have erected seven altars, and have laid on everyone a
calf and a ram.</p>

<p>23:5. And the Lord put the word in his mouth, and said: Return to Balac,
and thus shalt thou speak.</p>

<p>23:6. Returning he found Balac standing by his burnt offering, with all
the princes of the Moabites:</p>

<p>23:7. And taking up his parable, he said: Balac king of the Moabites
hath brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east: Come, said
he, and curse Jacob: make haste and detest Israel.</p>

<p>23:8. How shall I curse him, whom God hath not cursed? By what means
should I detest him, whom the Lord detesteth not?</p>

<p>23:9. I shall see him from the tops of the rocks, and shall consider him
from the hills. This people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned
among the nations.</p>

<p>23:10. Who can count the dust of Jacob, and know the number of the stock
of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the just, and my last end be
like to them.</p>

<p>23:11. And Balac said to Balaam: What is this that thou dost? I sent for
thee to curse my enemies: and thou contrariwise blessest them.</p>

<p>23:12. He answered him: Can I speak any thing else but what the Lord
commandeth?</p>

<p>23:13. Balac therefore said: Come with me to another place from whence
thou mayest see part of Israel, and canst not see them all: curse them
from thence.</p>

<p>23:14. And when he had brought him to a high place, upon the top of
mount Phasga, Balaam built seven altars, and laying on every one a calf
and a ram,</p>

<p>23:15. He said to Balac: Stand here by thy burnt offering while I go to
meet him.</p>

<p>23:16. And when the Lord had met him, and had put the word in his mouth,
he said: Return to Balac, and thus shalt thou say to him.</p>

<p>23:17. Returning he found him standing by his burnt sacrifice, and the
princes of the Moabites with him. And Balac said to him: What hath the
Lord spoken?</p>

<p>23:18. But he taking up his parable, said: Stand, O Balac, and give ear:
hear, thou son of Sephor:</p>

<p>23:19. God is not a man, that he should lie, nor is the son of man, that
he should be changed. Hath he said then, and will he not do? hath he
spoken, and will he not fulfil?</p>

<p>23:20. I was brought to bless, the blessing I am not able to hinder.</p>

<p>23:21. There is no idol in Jacob, neither is there an image god to be
seen in Israel. The Lord his God is with him, and the sound of the
victory of the king in him.</p>

<p>23:22. God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose strength is like to the
rhinoceros.</p>

<p>23:23. There is no soothsaying in Jacob, nor divination in Israel. In
their times it shall be told to Jacob and to Israel what God hath
wrought.</p>

<p>23:24. Behold the people shall rise up as a lioness, and shall lift
itself up as a lion: it shall not lie down till it devour the prey, and
drink the blood of the slain.</p>

<p>23:25. And Balac said to Balaam: Neither curse, nor bless him.</p>

<p>23:26. And he said: Did I not tell thee, that whatsoever God should
command me, that I would do?</p>

<p>23:27. And Balac said to him: Come and I will bring thee to another
place; if peradventure it please God that thou mayest curse them from
thence.</p>

<p>23:28. And when he had brought him upon the top of mount Phogor, which
looketh towards the wilderness,</p>

<p>23:29. Balaam said to him: Build me here seven altars, and prepare as
many calves, and the same number of rams.</p>

<p>23:30. Balac did as Balaam had said: and he laid on every altar, a calf
and a ram.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 24</p>

<p>Balaam still continues to prophesy good things in favour of Israel.</p>

<p>24:1. And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord that he should bless
Israel, he went not as he had gone before, to seek divination: but
setting his face towards the desert,</p>

<p>24:2. And lifting up his eyes, he saw Israel abiding in their tents by
their tribes: and the spirit of God rushing upon him,</p>

<p>24:3. He took up his parable and said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said:
The man hath said, whose eye is stopped up:</p>

<p>24:4. The bearer of the words of God hath said, he that hath beheld the
vision of the Almighty, he that falleth, and so his eyes are opened:</p>

<p>24:5. How beautiful are thy tabernacles O Jacob, and thy tents, O
Israel!</p>

<p>24:6. As woody valleys, as watered gardens near the rivers, as
tabernacles which the Lord hath pitched, as cedars by the waterside.</p>

<p>24:7. Water shall flow out of his bucket, and his seed shall be in many
waters. For Agag his king shall be removed, and his kingdom shall be
taken away.</p>

<p>24:8. God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose strength is like to the
rhinoceros. They shall devour the nations that are his enemies, and
break their bones, and pierce them with arrows.</p>

<p>24:9. Lying down he hath slept as a lion, and as a lioness, whom none
shall dare to rouse. He that blesseth thee, shall also himself be
blessed: he that curseth thee shall be reckoned accursed.</p>

<p>24:10. And Balac being angry against Balaam, clapped his hands together
and said: I called thee to curse my enemies, and thou on the contrary
hast blessed them three times.</p>

<p>24:11. Return to thy place. I had determined indeed greatly to honour
thee, but the Lord hath deprived thee of the honour designed for thee.</p>

<p>24:12. Balaam made answer to Balac: Did I not say to thy messengers,
whom thou sentest to me:</p>

<p>24:13. If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to utter any thing of my
own head either good or evil: but whatsoever the Lord shall say, that I
will speak?</p>

<p>24:14. But yet going to my people, I will give thee counsel, what this
people shall do to thy people in the latter days.</p>

<p>24:15. Therefore taking up his parable, again he said: Balaam the son of
Beor hath said: The man whose eye is stopped up, hath said:</p>

<p>24:16. The hearer of the words of God hath said, who knoweth the
doctrine of the Highest, and seeth the visions of the Almighty, who
falling hath his eyes opened:</p>

<p>24:17. I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near. A
STAR SHALL RISE out of Jacob and a sceptre shall spring up from Israel:
and shall strike the chiefs of Moab, and shall waste all the children of
Seth</p>

<p>24:18. And he shall possess Idumea: the inheritance of Seir shall come
to their enemies, but Israel shall do manfully.</p>

<p>24:19. Out of Jacob shall he come that shall rule, and shall destroy the
remains of the city.</p>

<p>24:20. And when he saw Amalec, he took up his parable, and said: Amalec
the beginning of nations, whose latter ends shall be destroyed.</p>

<p>24:21. He saw also the Cinite: and took up his parable, and said: Thy
habitation indeed is strong: but though thou build thy nest in a rock,</p>

<p>24:22. And thou be chosen of the stock of Cin, how long shalt thou be
able to continue? For Assur shall take thee captive.</p>

<p>24:23. And taking up his parable, again he said: Alas, who shall live
when God shall do these things?</p>

<p>24:24. They shall come in galleys from Italy, they shall overcome the
Assyrians, and shall waste the Hebrews, and at the last they themselves
also shall perish.</p>

<p>24:25. And Balaam rose, and returned to his place: Balac also returned
the way that he came.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 25</p>

<p>The people fall into fornication and idolatry; for which twenty-four
thousand are slain. The zeal of Phinees.</p>

<p>25:1. And Israel at that time abode in Settim, and the people committed
fornication with the daughters of Moab,</p>

<p>25:2. Who called them to their sacrifices. And they ate of them, and
adored their gods.</p>

<p>25:3. And Israel was initiated to Beelphegor: upon which the Lord being
angry,</p>

<p>Initiated to Beelphegor... That is, they took to the worship of
Beelphegor, an obscene idol of the Moabites, and were consecrated, as it
were, to him.</p>

<p>25:4. Said to Moses: Take all the princes of the people, and hang them
up on gibbets against the sun: that my fury may be turned away from
Israel.</p>

<p>25:5. And Moses said to the judges of Israel: Let every man kill his
neighbours, that have been initiated to Beelphegor.</p>

<p>25:6. And behold one of the children of Israel went in before his
brethren to a harlot of Madian, in the sight of Moses and of all the
children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle.</p>

<p>25:7. And when Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
saw it, he rose up from the midst of the multitude, and taking a dagger,</p>

<p>25:8. Went in after the Israelite into the brothel house, and thrust
both of them through together, to wit, the man and the woman in the
genital parts. And the scourge ceased from the children of Israel.</p>

<p>25:9. And there were slain four and twenty thousand men.</p>

<p>25:10. And the Lord said to Moses:</p>

<p>25:11. Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, hath
turned away my wrath from the children of Israel: because he was moved
with my zeal against them, that I myself might not destroy the children
of Israel in my zeal.</p>

<p>25:12. Therefore say to him: behold I give him the peace of my covenant,</p>

<p>25:13. And the covenant of the priesthood for ever shall be both to him
and his seed, because he hath been zealous for his God, and hath made
atonement for the wickedness of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>25:14. And the name of the Israelite, that was slain with the woman of
Madian, was Zambri the son of Salu, a prince of the kindred and tribe of
Simeon.</p>

<p>25:15. And the Madianite woman, that was slain with him, was called
Cozbi the daughter of Sur, a most noble prince among the Madianites.</p>

<p>25:16. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>25:17. Let the Madianites find you their enemies, and slay you them:</p>

<p>25:18. Because they also have acted like enemies against you, and have
guilefully deceived you by the idol Phogor, and Cozbi their sister, a
daughter of a prince of Madian, who was slain in the day of the plague
for the sacrilege of Phogor.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 26</p>

<p>The people are again numbered by their tribes and families.</p>

<p>26:1. After the blood of the guilty was shed, the Lord said to Moses and
to Eleazar the son of Aaron, the priest:</p>

<p>26:2. Number the whole sum of the children of Israel from twenty years
old and upward, by their houses and kindreds, all that are able to go
forth to war.</p>

<p>26:3. Moses therefore and Eleazar the priest, being in the plains of
Moab upon the Jordan over against Jericho, spoke to them that were</p>

<p>26:4. From twenty years old and upward, as the Lord had commanded: and
this is the number of them:</p>

<p>26:5. Ruben the firstborn of Israel. His sons were Henoch, of whom is
the family of the Henochites: and Phallu, of whom is the family of the
Phalluites:</p>

<p>26:6. And Hesron, of whom is the family of the Hesronites: and Charmi,
of whom is the family of the Charmites.</p>

<p>26:7. These are the families of the stock of Ruben: whose number was
found to be forty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty.</p>

<p>26:8. The son of Phallu was Eliab.</p>

<p>26:9. His sons, were Namuel and Dathan and Abiron. These are Dathan and
Abiron the princes of the people, that rose against Moses and Aaron in
the sedition of Core, when they rebelled against the Lord:</p>

<p>26:10. And the earth opening her mouth swallowed up Core, many others
dying, when the fire burned two hundred and fifty men. &nbsp;And there was a
great miracle wrought,</p>

<p>26:11. That when Core perished, his sons did not perish.</p>

<p>26:12. The sons of Simeon by their kindreds: Namuel, of him is the
family of the Namuelites: Jamin, of him is the family of the Jaminites:

forty thousand five hundred.</p>

<p>26:19. The sons of Juda, Her and Onan, who both died in the land of
Chanaan.</p>

<p>26:20. And the sons of Juda by their kindreds were: Sela, of whom is the
family of the Selaites: Phares, of whom is the family of the Pharesites:
Zare, of whom is the family of the Zarites.</p>

<p>26:21. Moreover the sons of Phares were: Hesron, of whom is the family
of the Hesronites: and Hamul, of whom is the family of the Hamulites.</p>

<p>26:22. These are the families of Juda, of which the whole number was
seventy-six thousand five hundred.</p>

<p>26:23. The sons of Issachar, by their kindreds: Thola of whom is the

<p>26:27. These are the kindreds of Zabulon, whose number was sixty
thousand five hundred.</p>

<p>26:28. The sons of Joseph by their kindred, Manasses and Ephraim.</p>

<p>26:29. Of Manasses was born Machir, of whom is the family of the
Machirites. Machir begot Galaad, of whom is the family of the
Galaadites.</p>

<p>26:30. Galaad had sons: Jezer, of whom is the family of the Jezerites:
and Helec, of whom is the family of the Helecites:</p>

<p>26:31. And Asriel, of whom is the family of the Asrielites: and Sechem,
of whom is the family of the Sechemites:</p>

<p>26:32. And Semida, of whom is the family of the Semidaites: and Hepher,
of whom is the family of the Hepherites.</p>

<p>26:33. And Hepher was the father of Salphaad, who had no sons, but only
daughters, whose names are these: Maala, and Noa, and Hegla, and Melcha,
and Thersa.</p>

<p>26:34. These are the families of Manasses, and the number of them fifty-
two thousand seven hundred.</p>

<p>26:35. And the sons of Ephraim by their kindreds were these: Suthala, of
whom is the family of the Suthalaites: Becher, of whom is the family of
the Becherites: Thehen, of whom is the family of the Thehenites.</p>

<p>26:36. Now the son of Suthala was Heran, of whom is the family of the

<p>26:37. These are the kindreds of the sons of Ephraim: whose number was

family of the Ahiramites:</p>

<p>26:39. Supham, of whom is the family of the Suphamites: Hupham, of whom

<p>26:42. The sons of Dan by their kindreds: Suham, of whom is the family
of the Suhamites: These are the kindreds of Dan by their families.</p>

<p>26:43. All were Suhamites, whose number was sixty-four thousand four

<p>26:44. The sons of Aser by their kindreds: Jemna, of whom is the family

<p>26:49. Jeser, of whom is the family of the Jeserites: Sellem, of whom is
the family of the Sellemites.</p>

<p>26:50. These are the kindreds of the sons of Nephtali by their families:
whose number was forty-five thousand four hundred.</p>

<p>26:51. This is the sum of the children of Israel, that were reckoned up,
six hundred and one thousand seven hundred and thirty.</p>

<p>26:52. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>26:53. To these shall the land be divided for their possessions
according to the number of names.</p>

<p>26:54. To the greater number thou shalt give a greater portion, and to
the fewer a less: to every one, as they have now been reckoned up, shall
a possession be delivered:</p>

<p>26:55. Yet so that by lot the land be divided to the tribe and families.</p>

<p>26:56. Whatsoever shall fall by lot, that shall be taken by the more, or
the fewer.</p>

<p>26:57. This also is the number of the sons of Levi by their families:
Gerson, of whom is the family of the Gersonites: Caath, of whom is the
family of the Caathites: Merari, of whom is the family of the Merarites.</p>

<p>26:58. These are the families of Levi: The family of Lobni, the family

<p>26:59. Who had to wife Jochabed the daughter of Levi, who was born to
him in Egypt. She bore to her husband Amram sons, Aaron and Moses, and
Mary their sister.</p>

<p>26:60. Of Aaron were born Nadab and Abiu, and Eleazar and Ithamar:</p>

<p>26:61. Of whom Nadab and Abiu died, when they had offered the strange
fire before the Lord.</p>

<p>26:62. And all that were numbered, were twenty-three thousand males from
one month old and upward: for they were not reckoned up among the
children of Israel, neither was a possession given to them with the
rest.</p>

<p>26:63. This is the number of the children of Israel, that were enrolled
by Moses and Eleazar the priest, in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan,
over against Jericho.</p>

<p>26:64. Among whom there was not one of them that were numbered before by
Moses and Aaron in the desert of Sinai.</p>

<p>26:65. For the Lord had foretold that they should die in the wilderness.
And none remained of them, but Caleb the son of Jephone, and Josue the
son of Nun.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 27</p>

<p>The law of inheritance. Josue is appointed to succeed Moses.</p>

<p>27:1. Then came the daughters of Salphaad, the son of Hepher, the son of
Galaad, the son of Machir, the son of Manasses, who was the son of
Joseph: and their names are Maala, and Noa, and Hegla, and Melcha, and
Thersa.</p>

<p>27:2. And they stood before Moses and Eleazar the priest, and all the
princes of the people at the door of the tabernacle of the covenant, and
said:</p>

<p>27:3. Our father died in the desert, and was not in the sedition, that
was raised against the Lord under Core, but he died in his own sin: and
he had no male children. Why is his name taken away out of his family,
because he had no son? Give us a possession among the kinsmen of our
father.</p>

<p>27:4. And Moses referred their cause to the judgment of the Lord.</p>

<p>27:5. And the Lord said to him:</p>

<p>27:6. The daughters of Salphaad demand a just thing: Give them a
possession among their father's kindred, and let them succeed him in his
inheritance.</p>

<p>27:7. And to the children of Israel thou shalt speak these things:</p>

<p>27:8. When a man dieth without a son, his inheritance shall pass to his
daughter.</p>

<p>27:9. If he have no daughter, his brethren shall succeed him.</p>

<p>27:10. And if he have no brethren, you shall give the inheritance to his
father's brethren.</p>

<p>27:11. But if he have no uncles by the father, the inheritance shall be
given to them that are the next akin. And this shall be to the children
of Israel sacred by a perpetual law, as the Lord hath commanded Moses.</p>

<p>27:12. The Lord also said to Moses: Go up into this mountain Abarim, and
view from thence the land which I will give to the children of Israel.</p>

<p>27:13. And when thou shalt have seen it, thou also shalt go to thy
people, as thy brother Aaron is gone:</p>

<p>27:14. Because you offended me in the desert of Sin in the contradiction
of the multitude, neither would you sanctify me before them at the
waters. These are the waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert of
Sin.</p>

<p>27:15. And Moses answered him:</p>

<p>27:16. May the Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh provide a man,
that may be over this multitude:</p>

<p>27:17. And may go out and in before them, and may lead them out, or
bring them in: lest the people of the Lord be as sheep without a
shepherd.</p>

<p>27:18. And the Lord said to him: take Josue the son of Nun, a man in
whom is the Spirit, and put thy hand upon him.</p>

<p>27:19. And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest and all the
multitude:</p>

<p>27:20. And thou shalt give him precepts in the sight of all, and part of
thy glory, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may hear
him.</p>

<p>27:21. If any thing be to be done, Eleazar the priest shall consult the
Lord for him. He and all the children of Israel with him, and the rest
of the multitude shall go out and go in at his word.</p>

<p>27:22. Moses did as the Lord had commanded. And, when he had taken
Josue, he set him before Eleazar the priest, and all the assembly of the
people,</p>

<p>27:23. And laying his hands on his head, he repeated all things that the
Lord had commanded.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 28</p>

<p>Sacrifices are appointed as well for every day as for sabbaths, and
other festivals.</p>

<p>28:1. The Lord also said to Moses:</p>

<p>28:2. Command the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: Offer
ye my oblation and my bread, and burnt sacrifice of most sweet odour, in
their due seasons.</p>

<p>28:3. These are the sacrifices which you shall offer: Two lambs of a
year old without blemish every day for the perpetual holocaust:</p>

<p>28:4. One you shall offer in the mornings, and the other in the evening:</p>

<p>28:5. And the tenth part of an ephi of flour, which shall be tempered
with the, purest oil, of the measure of the fourth part of a hin.</p>

<p>28:6. It is the continual holocaust which you offered in mount Sinai for
a most sweet odour of a sacrifice by fire to the Lord.</p>

<p>28:7. And for a libation you shall offer of wine the fourth part of a
hin for every lamb in the sanctuary of the Lord.</p>

<p>28:8. And you shall offer the other lamb in like manner in the evening
according to all the rites of the morning sacrifice, and of the
libations thereof, an oblation of most sweet odour to the Lord.</p>

<p>28:9. And on the sabbath day you shall offer two lambs of a year old
without blemish, and two tenths of flour tempered with oil in sacrifice,
and the libations,</p>

<p>28:10. Which regularly are poured out every sabbath for the perpetual
holocaust.</p>

<p>28:11. And on the first day of the month you shall offer a holocaust to
the Lord, two calves of the herd, one ram, and seven lambs of a year
old, without blemish,</p>

<p>28:12. And three tenths of flour tempered with oil in sacrifice for
every calf: and two tenths of flour tempered with oil for every ram:</p>

<p>28:13. And the tenth of a tenth of flour tempered with oil in sacrifice
for every lamb. It is a holocaust of most sweet odour and an offering by
fire to the Lord.</p>

<p>28:14. And these shall be the libations of wine that are to be poured
out for every victim: Half a hin for every calf, a third for a ram, and
a fourth for a lamb. This shall be the holocaust for every month, as
they succeed one another in the course of the year.</p>

<p>28:15. A buck goat also shall be offered to the Lord for a sin offering
over and above the perpetual holocaust with its libations.</p>

<p>28:16. And in the first month, on the four tenth day of the month, shall
be the phase of the Lord,</p>

<p>28:17. And on the fifteenth day the solemn feast: seven days shall they
eat unleavened bread.</p>

<p>28:18. And the first day of them shall be venerable and holy: you shall
not do any servile work therein.</p>

<p>28:19. And you shall offer a burnt sacrifice a holocaust to the Lord,
two calves of the herd, one ram, seven lambs of a year old, without
blemish:</p>

<p>28:20. And for the sacrifice of every one three tenths of flour which
shall be tempered with oil to every calf, and two tenths to every ram,</p>

<p>28:21. And the tenth of a tenth, to every lamb, that is to say, to all
the seven lambs:</p>

<p>28:22. And one buck goat for sin, to make atonement for you,</p>

<p>28:23. Besides the morning holocaust which you shall always offer.</p>

<p>28:24. So shall you do every day of the seven days for the food of the
fire, and for a most sweet odour to the Lord, which shall rise from the
holocaust, and from the libations of each.</p>

<p>28:25. The seventh day also shall be most solemn and holy unto you, you
shall do no servile work therein.</p>

<p>28:26. The day also of firstfruits, when after the weeks are
accomplished, you shall offer new fruits to the Lord, shall be venerable
and holy: you shall do no servile work therein.</p>

<p>28:27. And you shall offer a holocaust for a most sweet odour to the
Lord, two calves of the herd, one ram, and seven lambs of a year old,
without blemish:</p>

<p>28:28. And in the sacrifices of them three tenths of flour tempered with
oil to every calf, two to every ram,</p>

<p>28:29. The tenth of a tenth to every lamb, which in all are seven lambs:
a buck goat also,</p>

<p>28:30. Which is slain for expiation: besides the perpetual holocaust and
the libations thereof.</p>

<p>28:31. You shall offer them all without blemish with their libations.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 29</p>

<p>Sacrifices for the festivals of the seventh month.</p>

<p>29:1. The first day also of the seventh month shall be venerable and
holy unto you; you shall do no servile work therein, because it is the
day of the sounding and of trumpets.</p>

<p>29:2. And you shall offer a holocaust for a most sweet odour to the
Lord, one calf of the herd, one ram and seven lambs of a year old,

<p>29:4. One tenth to a lamb, which in all are seven lambs:</p>

<p>29:5. And a buck goat for sin, which is offered for the expiation of the
people,</p>

<p>29:6. Besides the holocaust of the first day of the month with the

for a most sweet odour to the Lord.</p>

<p>29:7. The tenth day also of this seventh month shall be holy and
venerable unto you, and you shall afflict your souls; you shall do no

their sacrifice and libations.</p>

<p>29:12. And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, which shall be
unto you holy and venerable, you shall do no servile work, but shall
celebrate a solemnity to the Lord seven days.</p>

<p>29:13. And you shall offer a holocaust for a most sweet odour to the
Lord, thirteen calves of the herd, two rams, and fourteen lambs of a

<p>29:14. And for their libations three tenths of flour tempered with oil
to every calf, being in all thirteen calves: and two tenths to each ram,

<p>Numbers Chapter 30</p>

<p>Of vows and oaths: and their obligation.</p>

<p>30:1. And Moses told the children of Israel all that the Lord had
commanded him:</p>

<p>30:2. And he said to the princes of the tribes of the children of
Israel: This is the word that the Lord hath commanded:</p>

<p>30:3. If any man make a vow to the Lord, or bind himself by an oath: he
shall not make his word void but shall fulfil all that he promised.</p>

<p>30:4. If a woman vow any thing, and bind herself by an oath, being in
her father's house, and but yet a girl in age: if her father knew the
vow that she hath promised, and the oath wherewith she hath bound her
soul, and held his peace, she shall be bound by the vow:</p>

<p>30:5. Whatsoever she promised and swore, she shall fulfil in deed.</p>

<p>30:6. But if her father, immediately as soon as he heard it, gainsaid
it, both her vows and her oaths shall be void, neither shall she be
bound to what she promised, because her father hath gainsaid it.</p>

<p>30:7. If she have a husband, and shall vow any thing, and the word once
going out of her mouth shall bind her soul by an oath,</p>

<p>30:8. The day that her husband shall hear it, and not gainsay it, she
shall be bound to the vow, and shall give whatsoever she promised.</p>

<p>30:9. But if as soon as he heareth he gainsay it, and make her promises
and the words wherewith she had bound her soul of no effect: the Lord
will forgive her.</p>

<p>30:10. The widow, and she that is divorced, shall fulfil whatsoever they
vow.</p>

<p>30:11. If the wife in the house of her husband, hath bound herself by
vow and by oath,</p>

<p>30:12. If her husband hear, and hold his peace, and doth not disallow
the promise, she shall accomplish whatsoever she had promised.</p>

<p>30:13. But if forthwith he gainsay it, she shall not be bound by the
promise: because her husband gainsaid it, and the Lord will be merciful
to her.</p>

<p>30:14. If she vow and bind herself by oath, to afflict her soul by
fasting, or abstinence from other things, it shall depend on the will of
her husband, whether she shall do it, or not do it.</p>

<p>30:15. But if the husband hearing it hold his peace, and defer the
declaring his mind till another day: whatsoever she had vowed and
promised, she shall fulfil: because immediately as he heard it, he held
his peace.</p>

<p>30:16. But if he gainsay it after that he knew it, he shall bear her
iniquity.</p>

<p>30:17. These are the laws which the Lord appointed to Moses between the
husband and the wife, between the father and the daughter that is as yet
but a girl in age, or that abideth in her father's house.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 31</p>

<p>The Madianites are slain for having drawn the people of Israel into sin.
The dividing of the booty.</p>

<p>31:1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>31:2. Revenge first the children of Israel on the Madianites, and so
thou shalt be gathered to thy people.</p>

<p>31:3. And Moses forthwith said: Arm of you men to fight, who may take
the revenge of the Lord on the Madianites.</p>

<p>31:4. Let a thousand men be chosen out of every tribe of Israel to be
sent to the war.</p>

<p>31:5. And they gave a thousand of every tribe, that is to say, twelve
thousand men well appointed for battle.</p>

<p>31:6. And Moses sent them with Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest,
and he delivered to him the holy vessels, and the trumpets to sound.</p>

<p>31:7. And when they had fought against the Madianites and had overcome
them, they slew all the men.</p>

<p>31:8. And their kings Evi, and Recem, and Sur, and Hur, and Rebe, five
princes of the nation: Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the
sword.</p>

<p>31:9. And they took their women, and their children captives, and all
their cattle, and all their goods: and all their possessions they
plundered:</p>

<p>31:10. And all their cities, and their villages, and castles, they
burned.</p>

<p>31:11. And they carried away the booty, and all that they had taken both
of men and of beasts.</p>

<p>31:12. And they brought them to Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and to
all the multitude of the children of Israel. But the rest of the things
for use they carried to the camp on the plains of Moab, beside the
Jordan over against Jericho.</p>

<p>31:13. And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the
synagogue went forth to meet them without the camp.</p>

<p>31:14. And Moses being angry with the chief officers of the army, the
tribunes, and the centurions that were come from the battle,</p>

<p>31:15. Said: Why have you saved the women?</p>

<p>31:16. Are not these they, that deceived the children of Israel by the
counsel of Balaam, and made you transgress against the Lord by the sin
of Phogor, for which also the people was punished?</p>

<p>The sin of Phogor... The sin &nbsp;committed in the worship of Beelphegor.</p>

<p>31:17. Therefore kill all that are of the male sex, even of the
children: and put to death the women, that have carnally known men.</p>

<p>Of children... Women and children, ordinarilly speaking, were not to be
killed in war, Deut. 20.14. But the great Lord of life and death was
pleased to order it otherwise in the present case, in detestation of the
wickedness of this people, who by the counsel of Balaam, had sent their
women among the Israelites on purpose to draw them from God.</p>

<p>31:18. But the girls, and all the women that are virgins save for
yourselves:</p>

<p>31:19. And stay without the camp seven days. He that hath killed a man,
or touched one that is killed, shall be purified the third day and the
seventh day.</p>

<p>31:20. And of all the spoil, every garment, or vessel, or any thing made
for use, of the skins, or hair of goats, or of wood, shall be purified.</p>

<p>31:21. Eleazar also the priest spoke to the men of the army, that had
fought, in this manner: This is the ordinance of the law, which the Lord
hath commanded Moses:</p>

<p>31:22. Gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,</p>

<p>31:23. And all that may pass through the fire, shall be purified by
fire, but whatsoever cannot abide the fire, shall be sanctified with the
water of expiation:</p>

<p>31:24. And you shall wash your garments the seventh day, and being
purified, you shall afterwards enter into the camp.</p>

<p>31:25. And the Lord said to Moses:</p>

<p>31:26. Take the sum of the things that were taken both of man and beast,
thou and Eleazar the priest and the princes of the multitude:</p>

<p>31:27. And thou shalt divide the spoil equally, between them that fought
and went out to the war, and between the rest of the multitude.</p>

<p>31:28. And thou shalt separate a portion to the Lord from them that
fought and were in the battle, one soul of five hundred as well of
persons as of oxen and asses and sheep.</p>

<p>31:29. And thou shalt give it to Eleazar the priest, because they are
the firstfruits of the Lord.</p>

<p>31:30. Out of the moiety also of the children of Israel thou shalt take
the fiftieth head of persons, and of oxen, and asses, and sheep, and of
all beasts, and thou shalt give them to the Levites that watch in the
charge of the tabernacle of the Lord.</p>

<p>31:31. And Moses and Eleazar did as the Lord had commanded.</p>

<p>31:32. And the spoil which the army had taken, was six hundred seventy-
five thousand sheep,</p>

<p>31:33. Seventy-two thousand oxen,</p>

<p>31:34. Sixty-one thousand asses:</p>

<p>31:35. And thirty-two thousand persons of the female sex, that had not
known men.</p>

<p>31:36. And one half was given to them that had been in the battle, to
wit, three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep:</p>

<p>31:37. Out of which, for the portion of the Lord, were reckoned six
hundred seventy five sheep.</p>

<p>31:38. And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen, seventy-two oxen:</p>

<p>31:39. Out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses, sixty-one asses:</p>

<p>31:40. Out of the sixteen thousand persons, there fell to the portion of
the Lord, thirty-two souls.</p>

<p>31:41. And Moses delivered the number of the firstfruits of the Lord to
Eleazar the priest, as had been commanded him,</p>

<p>31:42. Out of the half of the children of Israel, which he had separated
for them that had been in the battle.</p>

<p>31:43. But out of the half that fell to the rest of the multitude, that
is to say, out of the three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred
sheep,</p>

<p>31:44. And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen,</p>

<p>31:45. And out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses,</p>

<p>31:46. And out of the sixteen thousand persons,</p>

<p>31:47. Moses took the fiftieth head, and gave it to the Levites that
watched in the tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord had commanded.</p>

<p>31:48. And when the commanders of the army, and the tribunes and
centurions were come to Moses, they said:</p>

<p>31:49. We thy servants have reckoned up the number of the fighting men,
whom we had under our hand, and not so much as one was wanting.</p>

<p>31:50. Therefore we offer as gifts to the Lord what gold every one of us
could find in the booty, in garters and tablets, rings and bracelets,
and chains, that thou mayst pray to the Lord for us.</p>

<p>31:51. And Moses and Eleazar the priest received all the gold in divers
kinds,</p>

<p>31:52. In weight sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty sicles, from
the tribunes and from the centurions.</p>

<p>31:53. For that which every one had taken in the booty was his own.</p>

<p>31:54. And that which was received they brought into the tabernacle of
the testimony, for a memorial of the children of Israel before the Lord.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 32</p>

<p>The tribes of Ruben and Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasses, receive
their inheritance on the east side of Jordan, upon conditions approved
of by Moses.</p>

<p>32:1. And the sons of Ruben and Gad had many flocks of cattle, and their
substance in beasts was infinite. And when they saw the lands of Jazer
and Galaad fit for feeding cattle,</p>

<p>32:2. They came to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and the princes of the
multitude, and said:</p>

<p>32:3. Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nemra, Hesebon, and Eleale, and
Saban, and Nebo, and Beon,</p>

<p>32:4. The land, which the Lord hath conquered in the sight of the
children of Israel, is a very fertile soil for the feeding of beasts:
and we thy servants have very much cattle:</p>

<p>32:5. And we pray thee, if we have found favour in thy sight, that thou
give it to us thy servants in possession, and make us not pass over the
Jordan.</p>

<p>32:6. And Moses answered them: What, shall your brethren go to fight,
and will you sit here?</p>

<p>32:7. Why do ye overturn the minds of the children of Israel, that they
may not dare to pass into the place which the Lord hath given them?</p>

<p>32:8. Was it not thus your fathers did, when I sent from Cadesbarne to
view the land?</p>

<p>32:9. And when they were come as far as the valley of the cluster,
having viewed all the country, they overturned the hearts of the
children of Israel, that they should not enter into the coasts, which
the Lord gave them.</p>

<p>32:10. And he swore in his anger, saying:</p>

<p>32:11. If these men, that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old
and upward, shall see the land, which I promised with an oath to
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: because they would not follow me,</p>

<p>32:12. Except Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite, and Josue the son
of Nun: these have fulfilled my will.</p>

<p>32:13. And the Lord being angry against Israel, led them about through
the desert forty years, until the whole generation, that had done evil
in his sight, was consumed.</p>

<p>32:14. And behold, said he, you are risen up instead of your fathers,
the increase and offspring of sinful men, to augment the fury of the
Lord against Israel.</p>

<p>32:15. For if you will not follow him, he will leave the people in the
wilderness, and you shall be the cause of the destruction of all.</p>

<p>32:16. But they coming near, said: We will make sheepfolds, and stalls
for our cattle, and strong cities for our children:</p>

<p>32:17. And we ourselves will go armed and ready for battle before the
children of Israel, until we bring them in unto their places. &nbsp;Our
little ones, and all we have, shall be in walled cities, for fear of the
ambushes of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>32:18. We will not return into our houses until the children of Israel
possess their inheritance:</p>

<p>32:19. Neither will we seek any thing beyond the Jordan, because we have
already our possession on the east side thereof,</p>

<p>32:20. And Moses said to them: If you do what you promise, go on well
appointed for war before the Lord:</p>

<p>32:21. And let every fighting man pass over the Jordan, until the Lord
overthrow his enemies:</p>

<p>32:22. And all the land be brought under him, then shall you be
blameless before the Lord and before Israel, and you shall obtain the
countries that you desire, before the Lord.</p>

<p>32:23. But if you do not what you say, no man can doubt but you sin
against God: and know ye, that your sin shall overtake you.</p>

<p>32:24. Build therefore cities for your children, and folds and stalls
for your sheep and beasts, and accomplish what you have promised.</p>

<p>32:25. And the children of Gad and Ruben said to Moses: We are thy
servants, we will do what my lord commandeth.</p>

<p>32:26. We will leave our children, and our wives and sheep and cattle,
in the cities of Galaad:</p>

<p>32:27. And we thy servants all well appointed will march on to the war,
as thou, my lord, speakest.</p>

<p>32:28. Moses therefore commanded Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son
of Nun, and the princes of the families of all the tribes of Israel, and
said to them:</p>

<p>32:29. If the children of Gad, and the children of Ruben pass with you
over the Jordan, all armed for war before the Lord, and the land be made
subject to you: give them Galaad in possession.</p>

<p>32:30. But if they will not pass armed with you into the land of
Chanaan, let them receive places to dwell in among you.</p>

<p>32:31. And the children of Gad, and the children of Ruben answered: As
the Lord hath spoken to his servants, so will we do:</p>

<p>32:32. We will go armed before the Lord into the land of Chanaan, and we
confess that we have already received our possession beyond the Jordan.</p>

<p>32:33. Moses therefore gave to the children of Gad and of Ruben, and to
the half tribe of Manasses the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sehon king
of the Amorrhites, and the kingdom of Og king of Basan, and their land
and the cities thereof round about.</p>

<p>32:34. And the sons of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</p>

<p>32:35. And Etroth, and Sophan, and Jazer, and Jegbaa,</p>

<p>32:36. And Bethnemra, and Betharan, fenced cities, and folds for their
cattle.</p>

<p>32:37. But the children of Ruben built Hesebon, and Eleale, and
Cariathaim,</p>

<p>32:38. And Nabo, and Baalmeon (their names being changed) and Sabama:
giving names to the cities which they had built.</p>

<p>32:39. Moreover the children of Machir, the son of Manasses, went into
Galaad, and wasted it, cutting off the Amorrhites, the inhabitants
thereof.</p>

<p>32:40. And Moses gave the land of Galaad to Machir the son of Manasses,
and he dwelt in it.</p>

<p>32:41. And Jair the son of Manasses went, and took the villages thereof,
and he called them Havoth Jair, that is to say, the villages of Jair.</p>

<p>32:42. Nobe also went, and took Canath with the villages thereof: and he
called it by his own name, Nobe.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 33</p>

<p>The mansions or journeys of the children of Israel towards the land of
promise.</p>

<p>33:1. These are the mansions of the children of Israel, who went out of
Egypt by their troops under the conduct of Moses and Aaron,</p>

<p>The mansions... These mansions, or journeys of the children of Israel
from Egypt to the land of promise, were figures, according to the
fathers, of the steps and degrees by which Christians leaving sin are to
advance from virtue to virtue, till they come to the heavenly mansions,
after this life, to see and enjoy God.</p>

<p>33:2. Which Moses wrote down according to the places of their encamping,
which they changed by the commandment of the Lord.</p>

<p>33:3. Now the children of Israel departed from Ramesses the first month,
on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the phase, with a
mighty hand, in the sight of all the Egyptians,</p>

<p>33:4. Who were burying their firstborn, whom the Lord had slain (upon
their gods also he had executed vengeance,)</p>

<p>33:5. And they camped in Soccoth.</p>

<p>33:6. And from Soccoth they came into Etham, which is in the uttermost
borders of the wilderness.</p>

<p>33:7. Departing from thence they came over against Phihahiroth, which
looketh towards Beelsephon, and they camped before Magdalum.</p>

<p>33:8. And departing from Phihahiroth, they passed through the midst of
the sea into the wilderness: and having marched three days through the
desert of Etham, they camped in Mara.</p>

<p>33:9. And departing from Mara, they came into Elim, where there were
twelve fountains of waters, and seventy palm trees: and there they
camped.</p>

<p>33:10. But departing from thence also, they pitched their tents by the
Red Sea. And departing from the Red Sea,</p>

<p>33:11. They camped in the desert of Sin.</p>

<p>33:12. And they removed from thence, and came to Daphca.</p>

<p>33:13. And departing from Daphca, they camped in Alus.</p>

<p>33:14. And departing from Alus, they pitched their tents in Raphidim,
where the people wanted water to drink.</p>

<p>33:15. And departing from Raphidim, they camped in the desert of Sinai.</p>

<p>33:16. But departing also from the desert of Sinai, they came to the
graves of lust.</p>

<p>33:17. And departing from the graves of lust, they camped in Haseroth.</p>

<p>33:18. And from Haseroth they came to Rethma.</p>

<p>33:19. And departing from Rethma, they camped in Remmomphares.</p>

<p>33:20. And they departed from thence and came to Lebna.</p>

<p>33:21. Removing from Lebna they camped in Ressa.</p>

<p>33:22. And departing from Ressa, they came to Ceelatha.</p>

<p>33:23. And they removed from thence and camped in the mountain Sepher.</p>

<p>33:24. Departing from the mountain Sepher, they came to Arada,</p>

<p>33:25. From thence they went and camped in Maceloth.</p>

<p>33:26. And departing from Maceloth, they came to Thahath.</p>

<p>33:27. Removing from Thahath they camped in Thare.</p>

<p>33:28. And they departed from thence, and pitched their tents in Methca.</p>

<p>33:29. And removing from Methca, they camped in Hesmona.</p>

<p>33:30. And departing from Hesmona, they came to Moseroth.</p>

<p>33:31. And removing from Moseroth, they camped in Benejaacan.</p>

<p>33:32. And departing from Benejaacan, they came to mount Gadgad.</p>

<p>33:33. From thence they went and camped in Jetebatha.</p>

<p>33:34. And from Jetebatha they came to Hebrona.</p>

<p>33:35. And departing from Hebrona, they camped in Asiongaber.</p>

<p>33:36. They removed from thence and came into the desert of Sin, which
is Cades.</p>

<p>33:37. And departing from Cades, they camped in mount Hor, in the
uttermost borders of the land of Edom.</p>

<p>33:38. And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of
the Lord: and there he died in the fortieth year of the coming forth of
the children of Israel out of Egypt, the fifth month, the first day of
the month,</p>

<p>33:39. When he was a hundred and twenty-three years old.</p>

<p>33:40. And king Arad the Chanaanite, who dwelt towards the south, heard
that the children of Israel were come to the land of Chanaan.</p>

<p>33:41. And they departed from mount Hor, and camped in Salmona.</p>

<p>33:42. From whence they removed and came to Phunon.</p>

<p>33:43. And departing from Phunon, they camped in Oboth.</p>

<p>33:44. And from Oboth they came to Ijeabarim, which is in the borders of
the Moabites.</p>

<p>33:45. And departing from Ijeabarim they pitched their tents in
Dibongab.</p>

<p>33:46. From thence they went and camped in Helmondeblathaim.</p>

<p>33:47. And departing from Helmondeblathaim, they came to the mountains
of Abarim over against Nabo.</p>

<p>33:48. And departing from the mountains of Abarim, they passed to the
plains of Moab, by the Jordan, over against Jericho.</p>

<p>33:49. And there they camped from Bethsimoth even to Ablesatim in the
plains of the Moabites,</p>

<p>33:50. Where the Lord said to Moses:</p>

<p>33:51. Command the children of Israel, and say to them: When you shall
have passed over the Jordan, entering into the land of Chanaan,</p>

<p>33:52. Destroy all the inhabitants of that land: Beat down their
pillars, and break in pieces their statues, and waste all their high
places,</p>

<p>33:53. Cleansing the land, and dwelling in it. For I have given it you
for a possession.</p>

<p>33:54. And you shall divide it among you by lot. To the more you shall
give a larger part, and to the fewer a lesser. To every one as the lot
shall fall, so shall the inheritance be given. The possession shall be
divided by the tribes and the families.</p>

<p>33:55. But if you will not kill the inhabitants of the land: they that
remain, shall be unto you as nails in your eyes, and spears in your
sides, and they shall be your adversaries in the land of your
habitation.</p>

<p>33:56. And whatsoever I had thought to do to them, I will do to you.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 34</p>

<p>The limits of Chanaan; with the names of the men that make the division
of it.</p>

<p>34:1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>

<p>34:2. Command the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When
you are entered into the land of Chanaan, and it shall be fallen into
your possession by lot, it shall be bounded by these limits:</p>

<p>34:3. The south side shall begin from the wilderness of Sin, which is by
Edom: and shall have the most salt sea for its furthest limits eastward:</p>

<p>The most salt sea... The lake of Sodom, otherwise called the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>34:4. Which limits shall go round on the south side by the ascent of the
Scorpion and so into Senna, and reach toward the south as far as
Cadesbarne, from whence the frontiers shall go out to the town called
Adar, and shall reach as far as Asemona.</p>

<p>The Scorpion... A mountain so called from having a great number of
scorpions.</p>

<p>34:5. And the limits shall fetch a compass from Asemona to the torrent
of Egypt, and shall end in the shore of the great sea.</p>

<p>The great sea... The Mediterranean.</p>

<p>34:6. And the west side shall begin from the great sea, and the same
shall be the end thereof.</p>

<p>34:7. But toward the north side the borders shall begin from the great
sea, reaching to the most high mountain,</p>

<p>The most high mountain... Libanus.</p>

<p>34:8. From which they shall come to Emath, as far as the borders of
Sedada:</p>

<p>34:9. And the limits shall go as far as Zephrona, and the village of
Enan. These shall be the borders on the north side.</p>

<p>34:10. From thence they shall mark out the grounds towards the east side
from the village of Enan unto Sephama.</p>

<p>34:11. And from Sephama the bounds shall go down to Rebla over against
the fountain of Daphnis: from thence they shall come eastward to the sea
of Cenereth,</p>

<p>Sea of Cenereth... This is the sea of Galilee, illustrated by the
miracles of our Lord.</p>

<p>34:12. And shall reach as far as the Jordan, and at the last shall be
closed in by the most salt sea. This shall be your land with its borders
round about.</p>

<p>34:13. And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying: This shall be
the land which you shall possess by lot, and which the Lord hath
commanded to be given to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe.</p>

<p>34:14. For the tribe of the children of Ruben by their families, and the
tribe of the children of Gad according to the number of their kindreds,
and half of the tribe of Manasses,</p>

<p>34:15. That is, two tribes and a half, have received their portion
beyond the Jordan over against Jericho at the east side.</p>

<p>34:16. And the Lord said to Moses:</p>

<p>34:17. These are the names of the men, that shall divide the land unto
you: Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son of Nun,</p>

<p>34:18. And one prince of every tribe,</p>

<p>34:19. Whose names are these: Of the tribe of Juda, Caleb the son of
Jephone.</p>

<p>34:20. Of the tribe of Simeon, Samuel the son of Ammiud.</p>

<p>34:21. Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chaselon.</p>

<p>34:22. Of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bocci the son of Jogli.</p>

<p>34:23. Of the children of Joseph of the tribe of Manasses, Hanniel the
son of Ephod.</p>

<p>34:24. Of the tribe of Ephraim, Camuel the son of Sephtan.</p>

<p>34:25. Of the tribe of Zabulon, Elisaphan the son of Pharnach.</p>

<p>34:26. Of the tribe of Issachar, Phaltiel the prince, the son of Ozan.</p>

<p>34:27. Of the tribe of Aser, Ahiud the son of Salomi.</p>

<p>34:28. Of the tribe of Nephtali: Phedael the son of Ammiud.</p>

<p>34:29. These are they Whom the Lord hath commanded to divide the land of
Chanaan to the children of Israel.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 35</p>

<p>Cities are appointed for the Levites. Of which six are to be the cities
of refuge.</p>

<p>35:1. And the Lord spoke these things also to Moses in the plains of
Moab by the Jordan, over against Jericho:</p>

<p>35:2. Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites out
of their possessions,</p>

<p>35:3. Cities to dwell in, and their suburbs round about: that they may
abide in the towns, and the suburbs may be for them cattle and beasts:</p>

<p>35:4. Which suburbs shall reach from the walls of the cities outward, a
thousand paces on every side:</p>

<p>35:5. Toward the east shall be two thousand cubits: and toward the south
in like manner shall be two thousand cubits: toward the sea also, which
looketh to the west, shall be the same extent: and the north side shall
be bounded with the like limits. &nbsp;And the cities shall be in the midst,
and the suburbs without.</p>

<p>35:6. And among the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, six
shall be separated for refuge to fugitives, that he who hath shed blood
may flee to them: and besides these there shall be other forty-two
cities,</p>

<p>35:7. That is, in all forty-eight with their suburbs.</p>

<p>35:8. And of these cities which shall be given out of the possessions of
the children of Israel, from them that have more, more shall be taken:
and from them that have less, fewer. Each shall give towns to the
Levites according to the extent of their inheritance.</p>

<p>35:9. The Lord said to Moses:</p>

<p>35:10. Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When
you shall have passed over the Jordan into the land of Chanaan,</p>

<p>35:11. Determine what cities shall be for the refuge of fugitives, who
have shed blood against their will.</p>

<p>35:12. And when the fugitive shall be in them, the kinsman of him that
is slain may not have power to kill him, until he stand before the
multitude, and his cause be judged.</p>

<p>35:13. And of those cities, that are separated for the refuge of
fugitives,</p>

<p>35:14. Three shall be beyond the Jordan, and three in the land of
Chanaan,</p>

<p>35:15. As well for the children of Israel as for strangers and
sojourners, that he may flee to them, who hath shed blood against his
will.</p>

<p>35:16. If any man strike with iron, and he die that was struck: he shall
be guilty of murder, and he himself shall die.</p>

<p>35:17. If he throw a stone, and he that is struck die: he shall be
punished in the same manner.</p>

<p>35:18. If he that is struck with wood die: he shall be revenged by the
blood of him that struck him.</p>

<p>35:19. The kinsman of him that was slain, shall kill the murderer: as
soon as he apprehendeth him, he shall kill him.</p>

<p>35:20. If through hatred any one push a man, or fling any thing at him
with ill design:</p>

<p>35:21. Or being his enemy, strike him with his hand, and he die: the
striker shall be guilty of murder: the kinsman of him that was slain as
soon as he findeth him, shall kill him.</p>

<p>35:22. But if by chance medley, and without hatred,</p>

<p>35:23. And enmity, he do any of these things,</p>

<p>35:24. And this be proved in the hearing of the people, and the cause be
debated between him that struck, and the next of kin:</p>

<p>35:25. The innocent shall be delivered from the hand of the revenger,
and shall be brought back by sentence into the city, to which he had
fled, and he shall abide there until the death of the high priest, that
is anointed with the holy oil.</p>

<p>Until the death, etc... This mystically signified that our deliverance
was to be effected by the death of Christ, the high priest and the
anointed of God.</p>

<p>35:26. If the murderer be found without the limits of the cities that
are appointed for the banished,</p>

<p>35:27. And be struck by him that is the avenger of blood: he shall not
be guilty that killed him.</p>

<p>35:28. For the fugitive ought to have stayed in the city until the death
of the high priest: and after he is dead, then shall the manslayer
return to his own country.</p>

<p>35:29. These things shall be perpetual, and for an ordinance in all your
dwellings.</p>

<p>35:30. The murderer shall be punished by witnesses: none shall be
condemned upon the evidence of one man.</p>

<p>35:31. You shall not take money of him that is guilty of blood, but he
shall die forthwith.</p>

<p>35:32. The banished and fugitives before the death of the high priest
may by no means return into their own cities.</p>

<p>35:33. Defile not the land of your habitation, which is stained with the
blood of the innocent: neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by his
blood that hath shed the blood of another.</p>

<p>35:34. And thus shall your possession be cleansed, myself abiding with
you. For I am the Lord that dwell among the children of Israel.</p>

<p>Numbers Chapter 36</p>

<p>That the inheritances may not be alienated from one tribe to another,
all are to marry within their own tribes.</p>

<p>36:1. And the princes of the families of Galaad, the son of Machir, the
son of Manasses, of the stock of the children of Joseph, came and spoke
to Moses before the princes of Israel, and said:</p>

<p>36:2. The Lord hath commanded thee, my lord, that thou shouldst divide
the land by lot to the children of Israel, and that thou shouldst give
to the daughters of Salphaad our brother the possession due to their
father:</p>

<p>36:3. Now if men of another tribe take them to wives, their possession
will follow them, and being transferred to another tribe, will be a
diminishing of our inheritance.</p>

<p>36:4. And so it shall cone to pass, that when the jubilee, the is, the
fiftieth year of remission, is come, the distribution made by the lots
shall be confounded, and the possession of the one shall pass to the
others.</p>

<p>36:5. Moses answered the children of Israel, and said by the command of
the Lord: The tribe of the children of Joseph hath spoken rightly.</p>

<p>36:6. And this is the law promulgated by the Lord touching the daughters
of Salphaad: Let them marry to whom they will, only so that it be to men
of their own tribe.</p>

<p>36:7. Lest the possession of the children of Israel be mingled from
tribe to tribe. For all men shall marry wives of their own tribe and
kindred:</p>

<p>36:8. And all women shall take husbands of the same tribe: that the
inheritance may remain in the families.</p>

<p>36:9. And that the tribes be not mingled one with another, but remain so</p>

<p>36:10. As they were separated by the Lord. And the daughters of Salphaad
did as was commanded:</p>

<p>36:11. And Maala, and Thersa, and Hegla, and Melcha, and Noa were
married to the sons of their uncle by their father</p>

<p>36:12. Of the family of Manasses, who was the son of Joseph: and the
possession that had been allotted to them, remained in the tribe and
family of their father.</p>

<p>36:13. These are the commandments and judgment, which the Lord commanded
by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel, in the plains of Moab
upon the Jordan over against Jericho.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
