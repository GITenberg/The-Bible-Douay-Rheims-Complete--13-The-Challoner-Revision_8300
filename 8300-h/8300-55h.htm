<p>THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS</p>

<p>The Galatians, soon after St. Paul had preached the Gospel to them, were
seduced by some false teachers, who had been Jews and who were for
obliging all Christians, even those who had been Gentiles, to observe
circumcision and the other ceremonies of the Mosaical law. In this
Epistle, he refutes the pernicious doctrine of those teachers and also
their calumny against his mission and apostleship. The subject matter of
this Epistle is much the same as that to the Romans. It was written at
Ephesus, about twenty-three years after our Lord's Ascension.</p>

<p>
Galatians Chapter 1</p>

<p>He blames the Galatians for suffering themselves to be imposed upon by
new teachers. The apostle's calling.</p>

<p>1:1. Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ
and God the Father, who raised him from the dead:</p>

<p>1:2. And all the brethren who are with me: to the churches of Galatia.</p>

<p>1:3. Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father and from our Lord
Jesus Christ,</p>

<p>1:4. Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this
present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:</p>

<p>1:5. To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>1:6. I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into
the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.</p>

<p>1:7. Which is not another: only there are some that trouble you and
would pervert the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>1:8. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you
besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.</p>

<p>1:9. As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a
gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.</p>

<p>1:10. For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If
I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</p>

<p>1:11. For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was
preached by me is not according to man.</p>

<p>1:12. For neither did I receive it of man: nor did I learn it but by the
revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>1:13. For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'
religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God and
wasted it.</p>

<p>1:14. And I made progress in the Jew's religion above many of my equals
in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my
fathers.</p>

<p>1:15. But when it pleased him who separated me from my mother's womb and
called me by his grace,</p>

<p>1:16. To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the
Gentiles: immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.</p>

<p>1:17. Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me:
but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.</p>

<p>1:18. Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem to see Peter: and I
tarried with him fifteen days.</p>

<p>1:19. But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of
the Lord.</p>

<p>1:20. Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie
not.</p>

<p>1:21. Afterwards, I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</p>

<p>1:22. And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in
Christ:</p>

<p>1:23. But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past doth
now preach the faith which once he impugned.</p>

<p>1:24. And they glorified God in me.</p>

<p>Galatians Chapter 2</p>

<p>The apostle's preaching was approved of by the other apostles. &nbsp;The
Gentiles were not to be constrained to the observance of the law.</p>

<p>2:1. Then, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with
Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</p>

<p>2:2. And I went up according to revelation and communicated to them the
gospel which I preach among the Gentiles: but apart to them who seemed
to be some thing: lest perhaps I should run or had run in vain.</p>

<p>2:3. But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled
to be circumcised.</p>

<p>2:4. But because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in
privately to spy our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they
might bring us into servitude.</p>

<p>2:5. To whom we yielded not by subjection: no, not for an hour: that the
truth of the gospel might continue with you.</p>

<p>2:6. But of them who seemed to be some thing, (what they were some time
it is nothing to me, God accepteth not the person of man): for to me
they that seemed to be some thing added nothing.</p>

<p>2:7. But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me was committed the
gospel of the uncircumcision, as to Peter was that of the circumcision.</p>

<p>The gospel of the uncircumcision... The preaching of the gospel to the
uncircumcised, that is, to the Gentiles. St. Paul was called in an
extraordinary manner to be the apostle of the Gentiles; St. Peter,
besides his general commission over the whole flock, (John 21. 15,
etc.,) had a peculiar charge of the people of the circumscision, that
is, of the Jews.</p>

<p>2:8. (For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision
wrought in me also among the Gentiles.)</p>

<p>2:9. And when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and
Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the
right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they
unto the circumcision:</p>

<p>2:10. Only that we should be mindful of the poor: which same thing also
I was careful to do.</p>

<p>2:11. But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face,
because he was to be blamed.</p>

<p>I withstood, etc... The fault that is here noted in the conduct of St.
Peter, was only a certain imprudence, in withdrawing himself from the
table of the Gentiles, for fear of giving offence to the Jewish
converts; but this, in such circumstances, when his so doing might be of
ill consequence to the Gentiles, who might be induced thereby to think
themselves obliged to conform to the Jewish way of living, to the
prejudice of their Christian liberty. Neither was St. Paul's
reprehending him any argument against his supremacy; for in such cases
an inferior may, and sometimes ought, with respect, to admonish his
superior.</p>

<p>2:12. For before that some came from James, he did eat with the
Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself,
fearing them who were of the circumcision.</p>

<p>2:13. And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented: so that
Barnabas also was led by them into that dissimulation.</p>

<p>2:14. But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of
the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all: If thou, being a Jew,
livest after the manner of the Gentiles and not as the Jews do, how dost
thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</p>

<p>2:15. We by nature are Jews: and not of the Gentiles, sinners.</p>

<p>2:16. But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law, but
by the faith of Jesus Christ, we also believe in Christ Jesus, that we
may be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law:
because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</p>

<p>2:17. But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also
are found sinners, is Christ then the minister of sin? God forbid!</p>

<p>2:18. For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed, I make
myself a prevaricator.</p>

<p>2:19. For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live to
God; with Christ I am nailed to the cross.</p>

<p>2:20. And I live, now not I: but Christ liveth in me. And that I live
now in the flesh: I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me
and delivered himself for me.</p>

<p>2:21. I cast not away the grace of God. For if justice be by the law,
then Christ died in vain.</p>

<p>Galatians Chapter 3</p>

<p>The Spirit, and the blessing promised to Abraham cometh not by the law,
but by faith.</p>

<p>3:1. O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not
obey the truth: before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth,
crucified among you?</p>

<p>3:2. This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the
works of the law or by the hearing of faith?</p>

<p>3:3. Are you so foolish that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would
now be made perfect by the flesh?</p>

<p>3:4. Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet in vain.</p>

<p>3:5. He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles
among you: doth he do it by the works of the law or by the hearing of
the faith?</p>

<p>3:6. As it is written: Abraham believed God: and it was reputed to him
unto justice.</p>

<p>3:7. Know ye, therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the
children of Abraham.</p>

<p>3:8. And the scripture, foreseeing that God justifieth the Gentiles by
faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.</p>

<p>3:9. Therefore, they that are of faith shall be blessed with faithful
Abraham.</p>

<p>3:10. For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For
it is written: Cursed is every one that abideth, not in all things which
are written in the book of the law to do them.</p>

<p>3:11. But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest:
because the just man liveth by faith.</p>

<p>3:12. But the law is not of faith: but he that doth those things shall
live in them.</p>

<p>3:13. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
curse for us (for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a
tree).</p>

<p>3:14. That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through
Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.</p>

<p>3:15. Brethren (I speak after the manner of man), yet a man's testament,
if it be confirmed, no man despiseth nor addeth to it.</p>

<p>3:16. To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not:
And to his seeds as of many. But as of one: And to thy seed, which is
Christ.</p>

<p>3:17. Now this I say: that the testament which was confirmed by God, the
law which was made after four hundred and thirty years doth not
disannul, to make the promise of no effect.</p>

<p>3:18. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise.
But God gave it to Abraham by promise.</p>

<p>3:19. Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until
the seed should come to whom he made the promise, being ordained by
angels in the hand of a mediator.</p>

<p>Because of transgressions... To restrain them from sin, by fear and
threats. Ordained by angels... The law was delivered by angels, speaking
in the name and person of God to Moses, who was the mediator, on this
occasion, between God and the people.</p>

<p>3:20. Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.</p>

<p>3:21. Was the law then against the promises of God: God forbid! &nbsp;For if
there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should
have been by the law.</p>

<p>3:22. But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise,
by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.</p>

<p>Hath concluded all under sin... that is, hath declared all to be under
sin, from which they could not be delivered but by faith in Jesus
Christ, the promised seed.</p>

<p>3:23. But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up,
unto that faith which was to be revealed.</p>

<p>3:24. Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ: that we might be
justified by faith.</p>

<p>Pedagogue... That is, schoolmaster, conductor, or instructor.</p>

<p>3:25. But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.</p>

<p>3:26. For you are all the children of God, by faith in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>3:27. For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ have put on
Christ.</p>

<p>3:28. There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free:
there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Neither Jew, etc... That is, no distinction of Jew, etc.</p>

<p>3:29. And if you be Christ's, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs
according to the promise.</p>

<p>Galatians Chapter 4</p>

<p>Christ has freed us from the servitude of the law. We are the freeborn
sons of Abraham.</p>

<p>4:1. As long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a
servant, though he be lord of all,</p>

<p>4:2. But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the
father.</p>

<p>4:3. So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements
of the world.</p>

<p>Under the elements, etc... That is, under the first rudiments of
religion, in which the carnal Jews were trained up; or under those
corporeal creatures, used in their manifold rites, sacrifices, and
sacraments.</p>

<p>4:4. But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made
of a woman, made under the law:</p>

<p>4:5. That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might
receive the adoption of sons.</p>

<p>4:6. And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into
your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.</p>

<p>4:7. Therefore, now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an
heir also through God.</p>

<p>4:8. But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them who, by nature,
are not gods.</p>

<p>4:9. But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God:
how turn you again to the weak and needy elements which you desire to
serve again?</p>

<p>4:10. You observe days and months and times, and years.</p>

<p>You observe days, etc... He speaks not of the observation of the Lord's
day, or other Christian festivals; but either of the superstitious
observation of days lucky and unlucky; or else of the Jewish festivals,
to the observance of which, certain Jewish teachers sought to induce the
Galatians.</p>

<p>4:11. I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among
you.</p>

<p>4:12. Be ye as I, because I also am as you brethren, I beseech you. You
have not injured me at all.</p>

<p>4:13. And you know how, through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the
gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh.</p>

<p>4:14. You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of
God, even as Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>4:15. Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness that, if it
could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes and would have
given them to me.</p>

<p>4:16. Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</p>

<p>4:17. They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude
you, that you might be zealous for them.</p>

<p>4:18. But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and
not only when I am present with you.</p>

<p>4:19. My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be
formed in you.</p>

<p>4:20. And I would willingly be present with you now and change my voice:
because I am ashamed for you.</p>

<p>4:21. Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read
the law?</p>

<p>4:22. For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a
bondwoman and the other by a free woman.</p>

<p>4:23. But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh:
but he of the free woman was by promise.</p>

<p>4:24. Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two
testaments. The one from Mount Sina, engendering unto bondage, which is
Agar.</p>

<p>4:25. For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that
Jerusalem which now is: and is in bondage with her children.</p>

<p>4:26. But that Jerusalem which is above is free: which is our mother.</p>

<p>4:27. For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break
forth and cry thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the
desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.</p>

<p>4:28. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</p>

<p>4:29. But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him
that was after the spirit: so also it is now.</p>

<p>4:30. But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son:
for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free
woman.</p>

<p>4:31. So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman but of
the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free.</p>

<p>Galatians Chapter 5</p>

<p>He exhorts them to stand to their Christian liberty. Of the fruits of
the flesh and of the spirit.</p>

<p>5:1. Stand fast and be not held again under the yoke of bondage.</p>

<p>5:2. Behold, I Paul tell you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall
profit you nothing.</p>

<p>5:3. And I testify again to every man circumcising himself that he is a
debtor to do the whole law.</p>

<p>5:4. You are made void of Christ, you who are justified in the law: you
are fallen from grace.</p>

<p>5:5. For we in spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of justice.</p>

<p>5:6. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor
uncircumcision: but faith that worketh by Charity.</p>

<p>5:7. You did run well. What hath hindered you, that you should not obey
the truth?</p>

<p>5:8. This persuasion is not from him that calleth you.</p>

<p>5:9. A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump.</p>

<p>5:10. I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will not be of
another mind: but he that troubleth you shall bear the judgment,
whosoever he be.</p>

<p>5:11. And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer
persecution? Then is the scandal of the cross made void.</p>

<p>5:12. I would they were even cut off, who trouble you.</p>

<p>5:13. For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty. Only make not
liberty an occasion to the flesh: but by charity of the spirit serve one
another.</p>

<p>5:14. For all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself.</p>

<p>5:15. But if you bite and devour one another: take heed you be not
consumed one of another.</p>

<p>5:16. I say then: Walk in the spirit: and you shall not fulfill the
lusts of the flesh.</p>

<p>5:17. For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against
the flesh: For these are contrary one to another: so that you do not the
things that you would.</p>

<p>5:18. But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.</p>

<p>5:19. Now the works of the flesh are manifest: which are fornication,
uncleanness, immodesty, luxury,</p>

<p>5:20. Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths,
quarrels, dissensions, sects,</p>

<p>5:21. Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like. &nbsp;Of the
which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such
things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>5:22. But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, joy, peace, patience,
benignity, goodness, longanimity,</p>

<p>5:23. Mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against such there
is no law.</p>

<p>5:24. And they that are Christ's have crucified their flesh, with the
vices and concupiscences.</p>

<p>5:25. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</p>

<p>5:26. Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
envying one another.</p>

<p>Galatians Chapter 6</p>

<p>He exhorts to charity, humility and all virtue. He glories in nothing
but in the cross of Christ.</p>

<p>6:1. Brethren, and if a man be overtaken in any fault, you, who are
spiritual, instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering
thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</p>

<p>6:2. Bear ye one another's burdens: and so you shall fulfil the law of
Christ.</p>

<p>6:3. For if any man think himself to be some thing, whereas he is
nothing, he deceiveth himself.</p>

<p>6:4. But let every one prove his own work: and so he shall have glory in
himself only and not in another.</p>

<p>6:5. For every one shall bear his own burden.</p>

<p>6:6. And let him that is instructed in the word communicate to him that
instructeth him, in all good things.</p>

<p>6:7. Be not deceived: God is not mocked.</p>

<p>6:8. For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. &nbsp;For he
that soweth in his flesh of the flesh also shall reap corruption. But he
that soweth in the spirit of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.</p>

<p>6:9. And in doing good, let us not fail. For in due time we shall reap,
not failing.</p>

<p>6:10. Therefore, whilst we have time, let us work good to all men, but
especially to those who are of the household of the faith.</p>

<p>6:11. See what a letter I have written to you with my own hand.</p>

<p>6:12. For as many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you
to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer the persecution of the
cross of Christ.</p>

<p>6:13. For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law: but
they will have you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</p>

<p>6:14. But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ: by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</p>

<p>6:15. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
uncircumcision: but a new creature.</p>

<p>6:16. And whosoever shall follow this rule, peace on them and mercy: and
upon the Israel of God.</p>

<p>6:17. From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me: for I bear the
marks of the Lord Jesus in my body.</p>

<p>6:18. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren.
Amen.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
