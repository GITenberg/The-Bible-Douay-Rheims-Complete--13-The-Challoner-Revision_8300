<p>THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS</p>

<p>St. Paul, having preached the faith in the island of Crete, he ordained
his beloved disciple and companion, Titus, bishop, and left him there to
finish the work which he had begun. Afterwards the Apostle, on a journey
to Nicopolis, a city of Macedonia, wrote this Epistle to Titus, in which
he directs him to ordain bishops and priests for the different cities,
shewing him the principal qualities necessary for a bishop. He also
gives him particular advice for his own conduct to his flock, exhorting
him to hold to strictness of discipline, but seasoned with lenity. It
was written about thirty-three years after our Lord's Ascension.</p>

<p>
Titus Chapter 1</p>

<p>What kind of men he is to ordain priests. Some men are to be sharply
rebuked.</p>

<p>1:1. Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to
the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth, which
is according to godliness:</p>

<p>1:2. Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath
promised before the times of the world:</p>

<p>1:3. But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is
committed to me according to the commandment of God our Saviour:</p>

<p>1:4. To Titus, my beloved son according to the common faith, grace and
peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Saviour.</p>

<p>1:5. For this cause I left thee in Crete: that thou shouldest set in
order the things that are wanting and shouldest ordain priests in every
city, as I also appointed thee:</p>

<p>1:6. If any be without crime, the husband of one wife having faithful
children, not accused of riot or unruly.</p>

<p>1:7. For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not
proud, not subject to anger, nor given to wine, no striker, not greedy
of filthy lucre:</p>

<p>1:8. But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:</p>

<p>1:9. Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that
he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to convince the
gainsayers.</p>

<p>1:10. For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers and seducers:
especially they who are of the circumcision.</p>

<p>1:11. Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things
which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</p>

<p>1:12. One of them a prophet of their own, said: The Cretans are always
liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies.</p>

<p>1:13. This testimony is true. Wherefore, rebuke them sharply, that they
may be sound in the faith:</p>

<p>1:14. Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn
themselves away from the truth.</p>

<p>1:15. All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled
and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their
conscience are defiled.</p>

<p>1:16. They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him:
being abominable and incredulous and to every good work reprobate.</p>

<p>Titus Chapter 2</p>

<p>How he is to instruct both old and young. The duty of servants. &nbsp;The
Christian's rule of life.</p>

<p>2:1. But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine:</p>

<p>2:2. That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in
love, in patience.</p>

<p>2:3. The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers,
not given to much wine, teaching well:</p>

<p>2:4. That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their
husbands, to love their children.</p>

<p>2:5. To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle,
obedient to their husbands: that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>

<p>2:6. Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober.</p>

<p>2:7. In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in doctrine,
in integrity, in gravity,</p>

<p>2:8. The sound word that can not be blamed: that he who is on the
contrary part may be afraid, having no evil to say of us.</p>

<p>2:9. Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters: in all things
pleasing, not gainsaying:</p>

<p>2:10. Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they
may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>

<p>2:11. For the grace of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men:</p>

<p>2:12. Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we
should live soberly and justly and godly in this world,</p>

<p>2:13. Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great
God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>2:14. Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity
and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good
works.</p>

<p>2:15. These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority. &nbsp;Let
no man despise thee.</p>

<p>Titus Chapter 3</p>

<p>Other instructions and directions for life and doctrine.</p>

<p>3:1. Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to obey at a
word, to be ready to every good work.</p>

<p>3:2. To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious but gentle: shewing
all mildness towards all men.</p>

<p>3:3. For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring,
slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy,
hateful and hating one another.</p>

<p>3:4. But when the goodness and kindness of God our Saviour appeared:</p>

<p>3:5. Not by the works of justice which we have done, but according to
his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration and renovation of
the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>3:6. Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ
our Saviour:</p>

<p>3:7. That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs according to
hope of life everlasting.</p>

<p>3:8. It is a faithful saying. And these things I will have thee affirm
constantly, that they who believe in God may be careful to excel in good
works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>

<p>3:9. But avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and
strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain.</p>

<p>3:10. A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition,
avoid:</p>

<p>3:11. Knowing that he that is such an one is subverted and sinneth,
being condemned by his own judgment.</p>

<p>By his own judgment... Other offenders are judged, and cast out of the
church, by the sentence of the pastors of the same church. &nbsp;Heretics,
more unhappy, run out of the church of their own accord, and by doing
so, give judgment and sentence against their own souls.</p>

<p>3:12. When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, make haste to come
unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter.</p>

<p>3:13. Send forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollo, with care that nothing
be wanting to them.</p>

<p>3:14. And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary
uses: that they be not unfruitful.</p>

<p>3:15. All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in the
faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
