<p>THE PROPHECY OF AMOS</p>

<p>AMOS prophesied in Israel about the same time as Osee: and was called
from following the cattle to denounce GOD'S judgments to the people of
Israel, and the neighbouring nations, for their repeated crimes, in
which they continued without repentance.</p>

<p>
Amos Chapter 1</p>

<p>The prophet threatens Damascus, Gaza, Tyre, Edom, and Ammon with the
judgments of God, for their obstinacy in sin.</p>

<p>1:1. The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Thecua: which he
saw concerning Israel in the days of Ozias king of Juda, and in the days
of Jeroboam the son of Joas king of Israel two years before the
earthquake.</p>

<p>The earthquake... Many understand this of a great earthquake, which they
say was felt at the time that king Ozias attempted to offer incense in
the temple. But the best chronologists prove that the earthquake here
spoken of must have been before that time: because Jeroboam the second,
under whom Amos prophesied, was dead long before that attempt of Ozias.</p>

<p>1:2. And he said: The Lord will roar from Sion, and utter his voice from
Jerusalem: and the beautiful places of the shepherds have mourned, and
the top of Carmel is withered.</p>

<p>1:3. Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Damascus, and for four I
will not convert it: because they have thrashed Galaad with iron wains.</p>

<p>For three crimes-and for four... That is, for their many unrepented of
crimes.-Ibid. I will not convert it... That is, I will not spare them,
nor turn away the punishments I design to inflict upon them.</p>

<p>1:4. And I will send a fire into the house of Azael, and it shall devour
the houses of Benadad.</p>

<p>1:5. And I will break the bar of Damascus: and I will cut off the
inhabitants from the plain of the idol, and him that holdeth the sceptre
from the house of pleasure: and the people of Syria shall be carried
away to Cyrene, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>1:6. Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Gaza, and for four I will
not convert it: because they have carried away a perfect captivity to
shut them up in Edom.</p>

<p>1:7. And I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the
houses thereof.</p>

<p>1:8. And I will cut off the inhabitant from Azotus, and him that holdeth
the sceptre from Ascalon: and I will turn my hand against Accaron, and
the rest of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord God.</p>

<p>1:9. Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Tyre, and for four I will
not convert it: because they have shut up an entire captivity in Edom,
and have not remembered the covenant of brethren.</p>

<p>1:10. And I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour
the houses thereof.</p>

<p>1:11. Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Edom, and for four I will
not convert him: because he hath pursued his brother with the sword, and
hath carried on his fury, and hath kept his wrath to the end.</p>

<p>1:12. I will send a fire into Theman: and it shall devour the houses of
Bosra.</p>

<p>1:13. Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of the children of Ammon,
and for four I will not convert him: because he hath ripped up the women
with child of Galaad to enlarge his border.</p>

<p>1:14. And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabba: and it shall devour
the houses thereof with shouting in the day of battle, and with a
whirlwind in the day of trouble.</p>

<p>1:15. And Melchom shall go into captivity, both he, and his princes
together, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>Melchom... The god or idol of the Ammonites, otherwise called Moloch,
and Melech: which in Hebrew signifies a king, and Melchom their king.</p>

<p>Amos Chapter 2</p>

<p>The judgments with which God threatens Moab, Juda, and Israel for their
sins, and their ingratitude.</p>

<p>2:1. Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Moab, and for four I will
not convert him: because he hath burnt the bones of the king of Edom
even to ashes.</p>

<p>2:2. And I will send a fire into Moab, and it shall devour the houses of
Carioth: and Moab shall die with a noise, with the sound of the trumpet:</p>

<p>2:3. And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay
all his princes with him, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>2:4. Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Juda, and for four I will
not convert him: because he hath cast away the law of the Lord, and hath
not kept his commandments: for their idols have caused them to err,
after which their fathers have walked.</p>

<p>2:5. And I will send a fire into Juda, and it shall devour the houses of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>2:6. Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Israel, and for four I
will not convert him: because he hath sold the just man for silver, and
the poor man for a pair of shoes.</p>

<p>2:7. They bruise the heads of the poor upon the dust of the earth, and
turn aside the way of the humble: and the son and his father have gone
to the same young woman, to profane my holy name.</p>

<p>2:8. And they sat down upon garments laid to pledge by every altar: and
drank the wine of the condemned in the house of their God.</p>

<p>2:9. Yet I cast out the Amorrhite before their face: whose height was
like the height of cedars, and who was strong as an oak: and I destroyed
his fruit from above, and his roots beneath.</p>

<p>2:10. It is I that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and I led
you forty years through the wilderness, that you might possess the land
of the Amorrhite.</p>

<p>2:11. And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men
for Nazarites. Is it not so, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord?</p>

<p>2:12. And you will present wine to the Nazarites: and command the
prophets, saying: Prophesy not.</p>

<p>2:13. Behold, I will screak under you as a wain screaketh that is laden
with hay.</p>

<p>I will screak... Unable to bear any longer the enormous load of your
sins, etc. The spirit of God, as St. Jerome takes notice, accommodates
himself to the education of the prophet and inspires him with
comparisons taken from country affairs.</p>

<p>2:14. And flight shall perish from the swift, and the valiant shall not
possess his strength, neither shall the strong save his life.</p>

<p>2:15. And he that holdeth the bow shall not stand, and the swift of foot
shall not escape, neither shall the rider of the horse save his life.</p>

<p>2:16. And the stout of heart among the valiant shall flee away naked in
that day, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>Amos Chapter 3</p>

<p>The evils that shall fall upon Israel for their sins.</p>

<p>3:1. Hear the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning you, O ye
children of Israel: concerning the whole family that I brought up out of
the land of Egypt, saying:</p>

<p>3:2. You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore
will I visit upon you all your iniquities.</p>

<p>Visit upon... That is, punish.</p>

<p>3:3. Shall two walk together except they be agreed?</p>

<p>3:4. Will a lion roar in the forest, if he have no prey? will the lion's
whelp cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?</p>

<p>3:5. Will the bird fall into the snare upon the earth, if there be no
fowler? Shall the snare be taken up from the earth, before it hath taken
somewhat?</p>

<p>3:6. Shall the trumpet sound in a city, and the people not be afraid?
Shall there be evil in a city, which the Lord hath not done?</p>

<p>Evil in a city... He speaks of the evil of punishments of war, famine,
pestilence, desolation, etc., but not of the evil of sin, of which God
is not the author.</p>

<p>3:7. For the Lord God doth nothing without revealing his secret to his
servants the prophets.</p>

<p>3:8. The lion shall roar, who will not fear? The Lord God hath spoken,
who shall not prophesy?</p>

<p>3:9. Publish it in the houses of Azotus, and in the houses of the land
of Egypt, and say: Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria,
and behold the many follies in the midst thereof, and them that suffer
oppression in the inner rooms thereof.</p>

<p>3:10. And they have not known to do the right thing, saith the Lord,
storing up iniquity, and robberies in their houses.</p>

<p>3:11. Therefore thus saith the Lord God: The land shall be in
tribulation, and shall be compassed about: and thy strength shall be
taken away from thee, and thy houses shall be spoiled.</p>

<p>3:12. Thus saith the Lord: As if a shepherd should get out of the lion's
mouth two legs, or the tip of the ear: so shall the children of Israel
be taken out that dwell in Samaria, in a place of a bed, and in the
couch of Damascus.</p>

<p>3:13. Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord the God
of hosts:</p>

<p>3:14. That in the day when I shall begin to visit the transgressions of
Israel, I will visit upon him, and upon the altars of Bethel: and the
horns of the altars shall be cut off, and shall fall to the ground.</p>

<p>3:15. And I will strike the winter house with the summer house: and the
houses of ivory shall perish, and many houses shall be destroyed, saith
the Lord.</p>

<p>Amos Chapter 4</p>

<p>The Israelites are reproved for their oppressing the poor, for their
idolatry, and their incorrigibleness.</p>

<p>4:1. Hear this word, ye fat kine that are in the mountains of Samaria:
you that oppress the needy, and crush the poor: that say to your
masters: Bring, and we will drink.</p>

<p>Fat kine... He means the great ones that lived in plenty and wealth.</p>

<p>4:2. The Lord God hath sworn by his holiness, that lo, the days shall
come upon you, when they shall lift you up on pikes, and what shall
remain of you in boiling pots.</p>

<p>4:3. And you shall go out at the breaches one over against the other,
and you shall be cast forth into Armon, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>Armon... A foreign country; some understand it of Armenia.</p>

<p>4:4. Come ye to Bethel, and do wickedly: to Galgal, and multiply
transgressions: and bring in the morning your victims, your tithes in
three days.</p>

<p>4:5. And offer a sacrifice of praise with leaven: and call free
offerings, and proclaim it: for so you would do, O children of Israel,
saith the Lord God.</p>

<p>4:6. Whereupon I also have given you dulness of teeth in all your
cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet you have not returned
to me, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>4:7. I also have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three
months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon on city, and caused
it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon: and the
piece whereupon I rained not, withered.</p>

<p>4:8. And two and three cities went to one city to drink water, and were
not filled: yet you returned not to me, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>4:9. I struck you with a burning wind, and with mildew, the palmerworm
hath eaten up your many gardens, and your vineyards: your olive groves,
and fig groves: yet you returned not to me, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>4:10. I sent death upon you in the way of Egypt, I slew your young men
with the sword, even to the captivity of your horses: and I made the
stench of your camp to come up into your nostrils: yet you returned not
to me, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>4:11. I destroyed some of you, as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha, and
you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet you returned not
to me, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>4:12. Therefore I will do these things to thee, O Israel: and after I
shall have done these things to thee, be prepared to meet thy God, O
Israel.</p>

<p>4:13. For behold he that formeth the mountains and createth the wind,
and declareth his word to man, he that maketh the morning mist, and
walketh upon the high places of the earth: the Lord the God of hosts is
his name.</p>

<p>Amos Chapter 5</p>

<p>A lamentation for Israel: an exhortation to return to God.</p>

<p>5:1. Hear ye this word, which I take up concerning you for a
lamentation. The house of Israel is fallen, and it shall rise no more.</p>

<p>5:2. The virgin of Israel is cast down upon her land, there is none to
raise her up.</p>

<p>5:3. For thus saith the Lord God: The city, out of which came forth a
thousand, there shall be left in it a hundred: and out of which there
came a hundred, there shall be left in it ten, in the house of Israel.</p>

<p>5:4. For thus saith the Lord to the house of Israel: Seek ye me, and you
shall live.</p>

<p>5:5. But seek not Bethel, and go not into Galgal, neither shall you pass
over to Bersabee: for Galgal shall go into captivity, and Bethel shall
be unprofitable.</p>

<p>Bethel,-Galgal,-Bersabee... The places where they worshipped their
idols.</p>

<p>5:6. Seek ye the Lord, and live: lest the house of Joseph be burnt with
fire, and it shall devour, and there shall be none to quench Bethel.</p>

<p>5:7. You that turn judgment into wormwood, and forsake justice in the
land,</p>

<p>5:8. Seek him that maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and that turneth darkness
into morning, and that changeth day into night: that calleth the waters
of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The Lord is
his name.</p>

<p>Arcturus and Orion... Arcturus is a bright star in the north: Orion a
beautiful constellation in the south.</p>

<p>5:9. He that with a smile bringeth destruction upon the strong, and
waste upon the mighty.</p>

<p>With a smile... That is, with all ease, and without making any effort.</p>

<p>5:10. They have hated him that rebuketh in the gate: and have abhorred
him that speaketh perfectly.</p>

<p>5:11. Therefore because you robbed the poor, and took the choice prey
from him: you shall build houses with square stone, and shall not dwell
in them: you shall plant most delightful vineyards, and shall not drink
the wine of them.</p>

<p>5:12. Because I know your manifold crimes, and your grievous sins:
enemies of the just, taking bribes, and oppressing the poor in the gate.</p>

<p>5:13. Therefore the prudent shall keep silence at that time, for it is
an evil time.</p>

<p>5:14. Seek ye good, and not evil, that you may live: and the Lord the
God of hosts will be with you, as you have said.</p>

<p>5:15. Hate evil, and love good, and establish judgment in the gate: it
may be the Lord the God of hosts may have mercy on the remnant of
Joseph.</p>

<p>5:16. Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of hosts the sovereign Lord:
In every street there shall be wailing: and in all places that are
without, they shall say: Alas, alas! and they shall call the husbandman
to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to lament.</p>

<p>5:17. And in all vineyards there shall be wailing: because I will pass
through in the midst of thee, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>5:18. Woe to them that desire the day of the Lord: to what end is it for
you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light.</p>

<p>5:19. As if a man should flee from the face of a lion, and a bear should
meet him: or enter into the house, and lean with his hand upon the wall,
and a serpent should bite him.</p>

<p>5:20. Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light: and
obscurity, and no brightness in it?</p>

<p>5:21. I hate, and have rejected your festivities: and I will not receive
the odour of your assemblies.</p>

<p>5:22. And if you offer me holocausts, and your gifts, I will not receive
them: neither will I regard the vows of your fat beasts.</p>

<p>5:23. Take away from me the tumult of thy songs: and I will not hear the
canticles of thy harp.</p>

<p>5:24. But judgment shall be revealed as water, and justice as a mighty
torrent.</p>

<p>5:25. Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me in the desert for forty
years, O house of Israel?</p>

<p>Did you offer, etc... Except the sacrifices that were offered at the
first, in the dedication of the tabernacle, the Israelites offered no
sacrifices in the desert.</p>

<p>5:26. But you carried a tabernacle for your Moloch, and the image of your
idols, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.</p>

<p>A tabernacle, etc... All this alludes to the idolatry which they
committed, when they were drawn away by the daughters of Moab to the
worship of their gods. Num. 25.</p>

<p>5:27. And I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith
the Lord, the God of hosts is his name.</p>

<p>Amos Chapter 6</p>

<p>The desolation of Israel for their pride and luxury.</p>

<p>6:1. Woe to you that are wealthy in Sion, and to you that have
confidence in the mountain of Samaria: ye great men, heads of the
people, that go in with state into the house of Israel.</p>

<p>6:2. Pass ye over to Chalane, and see, and go from thence into Emath the
great: and go down into Geth of the Philistines, and to all the best
kingdoms of these: if their border be larger than your border.</p>

<p>6:3. You that are separated unto the evil day: and that approach to the
throne of iniquity;</p>

<p>6:4. You that sleep upon beds of ivory, and are wanton on your couches:
that eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of
the herd;</p>

<p>6:5. You that sing to the sound of the psaltery: they have thought
themselves to have instruments of music like David;</p>

<p>6:6. That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the best
ointments: and they are not concerned for the affliction of Joseph.</p>

<p>6:7. Wherefore now they shall go captive at the head of them that go
into captivity: and the faction of the luxurious ones shall be taken
away.</p>

<p>6:8. The Lord God hath sworn by his own soul, saith the Lord the God of
hosts: I detest the pride of Jacob, and I hate his houses, and I will
deliver up the city with the inhabitants thereof.</p>

<p>6:9. And if there remain ten men in one house, they also shall die.</p>

<p>6:10. And a man's kinsman shall take him up, and shall burn him, that he
may carry the bones out of the house; and he shall say to him that is in
the inner rooms of the house: Is there yet any with thee?</p>

<p>6:11. And he shall answer: There is an end. And he shall say to him:
Hold thy peace, and mention not the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>6:12. For behold the Lord hath commanded, and he will strike the greater
house with breaches, and the lesser house with clefts.</p>

<p>6:13. Can horses run upon the rocks, or can any one plough with buffles?
for you have turned judgment into bitterness, and the fruit of justice
into wormwood.</p>

<p>6:14. You that rejoice in a thing of nought: you that say: Have we not
taken unto us horns by our own strength?</p>

<p>6:15. But behold, I will raise up a nation against you, O house of
Israel, saith the Lord the God of hosts; and they shall destroy you from
the entrance of Emath, even to the torrent of the desert.</p>

<p>Amos Chapter 7</p>

<p>The prophet sees, in three visions, evils coming upon Israel: he is
accused of treason by the false priest of Bethel.</p>

<p>7:1. These things the Lord God shewed to me: and behold the locust was
formed in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter rain, and lo,
it was the latter rain after the king's mowing.</p>

<p>The locust, etc... These judgments by locusts and fire, which, by the
prophet's intercession, were moderated, signify the former invasions of
the Assyrians under Phul and Theglathphalasar, before the utter
desolation of Israel by Salmanasar.</p>

<p>7:2. And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the
grass of the land, I said: O Lord God, be merciful, I beseech thee: who
shall raise up Jacob, for he is very little?</p>

<p>7:3. The Lord had pity upon this: It shall not be, said the Lord.</p>

<p>7:4. These things the Lord God shewed to me: and behold the Lord called
for judgment unto fire, and it devoured the great deep, and ate up a
part at the same time.</p>

<p>7:5. And I said: O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee, who shall raise up
Jacob, for he is a little one?</p>

<p>7:6. The Lord had pity upon this. Yea this also shall not be, said the
Lord God.</p>

<p>7:7. These things the Lord shewed to me: and behold the Lord was
standing upon a plastered wall, and in his hand a mason's trowel.</p>

<p>7:8. And the Lord said to me: What seest thou, Amos? And I said: A
mason's trowel. And the Lord said: Behold, I will lay down the trowel in
the midst of my people Israel. I will plaster them over no more.</p>

<p>7:9. And the high places of the idol shall be thrown down, and the
sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste: and I will rise up against
the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</p>

<p>7:10. And Amasias the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel,
saying: Amos hath rebelled against thee in the midst of the house of
Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</p>

<p>7:11. For thus saith Amos: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel
shall be carried away captive out of their own land.</p>

<p>Jeroboam shall die by the sword... The prophet did not say this; but
that the Lord would rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the
sword: which was verified, when Zacharias, the son and successor of
Jeroboam, was slain by the sword. 4 Kings 15.10.</p>

<p>7:12. And Amasias said to Amos: Thou seer, go, flee away into the land
of Juda: and eat bread there, and prophesy there.</p>

<p>7:13. But prophesy not again any more in Bethel: because it is the
king's sanctuary, and it is the house of the kingdom.</p>

<p>7:14. And Amos answered and said to Amasias: I am not a prophet, nor am
I the son of a prophet: but I am a herdsman plucking wild figs.</p>

<p>I am not a prophet... That is, I am not a prophet by education: nor is
prophesying my calling or profession: but I am a herdsman, whom God was
pleased to send hither to prophesy to Israel.</p>

<p>7:15. And the Lord took me when I followed the flock, and the Lord said
to me: Go, prophesy to my people Israel.</p>

<p>7:16. And now hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, thou shalt
not prophesy against Israel, and thou shalt not drop thy word upon the
house of the idol.</p>

<p>The house of the idol... Viz., of the calf worshipped in Bethel.</p>

<p>7:17. Therefore thus saith the Lord: Thy wife shall play the harlot in
the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and
thy land shall be measured by a line: and thou shalt die in a polluted
land, and Israel shall go into captivity out of their land.</p>

<p>Amos Chapter 8</p>

<p>Under the figure of a hook, which bringeth down the fruit, the
approaching desolation of Israel is foreshewed for their avarice and
injustices.</p>

<p>8:1. These things the Lord shewed to me: and behold a hook to draw down
the fruit.</p>

<p>8:2. And he said: What seest thou, Amos? And I said: A hook to draw down
fruit. And the Lord said to me: The end is come upon my people Israel: I
will not again pass by them any more.</p>

<p>8:3. And the hinges of the temple shall screak in that day, saith the
Lord God: many shall die: silence shall be cast in every place.</p>

<p>8:4. Hear this, you that crush the poor, and make the needy of the land
to fail,</p>

<p>8:5. Saying: When will the month be over, and we shall sell our wares:
and the sabbath, and we shall open the corn: that we may lessen the
measure, and increase the sicle, and may convey in deceitful balances,</p>

<p>8:6. That we may possess the needy for money, and the poor for a pair of
shoes, and may sell the refuse of the corn?</p>

<p>8:7. The Lord hath sworn against the pride of Jacob: surely I will never
forget all their works.</p>

<p>8:8. Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that
dwelleth therein: and rise up altogether as a river, and be cast out,
and run down as the river of Egypt?</p>

<p>8:9. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God, that the
sun shall go down at midday, and I will make the earth dark in the day
of light:</p>

<p>8:10. And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into
lamentation: and I will bring up sackcloth upon every back of yours, and
baldness upon every head: and I will make it as the mourning of an only
son, and the latter end thereof as a bitter day.</p>

<p>8:11. Behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send forth a
famine into the land: not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but
of hearing the word of the Lord.</p>

<p>8:12. And they shall move from sea to sea, and from the north to the
east: they shall go about seeking the word of the Lord, and shall not
find it.</p>

<p>8:13. In that day the fair virgins, and the young men shall faint for
thirst.</p>

<p>8:14. They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say: Thy God, O Dan,
liveth: and the way of Bersabee liveth: and they shall fall, and shall
rise no more.</p>

<p>Amos Chapter 9</p>

<p>The certainty of the desolation of Israel: the restoring of the
tabernacle of David, and the conversion of the Gentiles to the church;
which shall flourish for ever.</p>

<p>9:1. I saw the Lord standing upon the altar, and he said: Strike the
hinges, and let the lintels be shook: for there is covetousness in the
head of them all, and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there
shall be no flight for them: they shall flee, and he that shall flee of
them shall not be delivered.</p>

<p>9:2. Though they go down even to hell, thence shall my hand bring them
out: and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down.</p>

<p>9:3. And though they be hid in the top of Carmel, I will search and take
them away from thence: and though they hide themselves from my eyes in
the depth of the sea, there will I command the serpent and he shall bite
them.</p>

<p>9:4. And if they go into captivity before their enemies, there will I
command the sword, and it shall kill them. And I will set my eyes upon
them for evil, and not for good.</p>

<p>9:5. And the Lord the God of hosts is he who toucheth the earth, and it
shall melt: and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up
as a river, and shall run down as the river of Egypt.</p>

<p>9:6. He that buildeth his ascension in heaven, and hath founded his
bundle upon the earth: who calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth
them out upon the face of the earth, the Lord is his name.</p>

<p>His ascension... That is, his high throne.-Ibid. His bundle... That is,
his church bound up together by the bands of one faith and communion.</p>

<p>9:7. Are not you as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children
of Israel, saith the Lord? did not I bring up Israel, out of the land of
Egypt: and the Philistines out of Cappadocia, and the Syrians out of
Cyrene?</p>

<p>As the children of the Ethiopians... That is, as black as they, by your
iniquities.</p>

<p>9:8. Behold the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom, and I
will destroy it from the face of the earth: but yet I will not utterly
destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>9:9. For behold I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel
among all nations, as corn is sifted in a sleve: and there shall not a
little stone fall to the ground.</p>

<p>9:10. All the sinners of my people shall fall by the sword: who say: The
evils shall not approach, and shall not come upon us.</p>

<p>9:11. In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David, that is
fallen: and I will close up the breaches of the walls thereof, and
repair what was fallen: and I will rebuild it as in the days of old.</p>

<p>9:12. That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all nations,
because my name is invoked upon them: saith the Lord that doth these
things.</p>

<p>9:13. Behold the days come, saith the Lord, when the ploughman shall
overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed: and
the mountains shall drop sweetness, and every hill shall be tilled.</p>

<p>Shall overtake, etc... By this is meant the great abundance of spiritual
blessings; which, as it were, by a constant succession, shall enrich the
church of Christ.</p>

<p>9:14. And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel: and they
shall build the abandoned cities, and inhabit them: and they shall plant
vineyards, and drink the wine of them: and shall make gardens, and eat
the fruits of them. And I will plant them upon their own land: and I
will no more pluck them out of their land which I have given them, saith
the Lord thy God.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
