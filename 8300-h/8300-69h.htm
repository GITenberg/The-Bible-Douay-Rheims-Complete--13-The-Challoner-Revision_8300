<p>THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE</p>

<p>The same vein of divine love and charity towards our neighbour, which
runs throughout the Gospel written by the beloved disciple and
Evangelist, St. John, is found also in his Epistles. He confirms the two
principal mysteries of faith: The mystery of the Trinity and the mystery
of the incarnation of Jesus Christ the Son of God. The sublimity and
excellence of the evangelical doctrine he declares: And this commandment
we have from God, that he, who loveth God, love also his brother (chap.
4,21). And again: For this is the charity of God, that we keep his
commandments, and: His commandments are not heavy (chap. 5,3). &nbsp;He shews
how to distinguish the children of God from those of the devil: marks
out those who should be called Antichrists: describes the turpitude and
gravity of sin. Finally, he shews how the sinner may hope for pardon. It
was written, according to Baronius' account, sixty-six years after our
Lord's Ascension.</p>

<p>
1 John Chapter 1</p>

<p>He declares what he has seen and heard of Christ who is the life
eternal, to the end that we may have fellowship with God and all good
through him. Yet so if we confess our sins.</p>

<p>1:1. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we
have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have
handled, of the word of life.</p>

<p>1:2. For the life was manifested: and we have seen and do bear witness
and declare unto you the life eternal, which was with the Father and
hath appeared to us.</p>

<p>1:3. That which we have seen and have heard, we declare unto you: that
you also may have fellowship with us and our fellowship may be with the
Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>1:4. And these things we write to you, that you may rejoice and your joy
may be full.</p>

<p>1:5. And this is the declaration which we have heard from him and
declare unto you: That God is light and in him there is no darkness.</p>

<p>1:6. If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we
lie and do not the truth.</p>

<p>1:7. But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the light, we have
fellowship one with another: And the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
cleanseth us from all sin.</p>

<p>1:8. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth
is not in us.</p>

<p>1:9. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our
sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity.</p>

<p>1:10. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar: and his
word is not in us.</p>

<p>1 John Chapter 2</p>

<p>Christ is our advocate. We must keep his commandments and love one
another. We must not love the world nor give ear to new teachers, but
abide by the spirit of God in the church.</p>

<p>2:1. My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not
sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the just. &nbsp;2:2. And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not
for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.</p>

<p>2:3. And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his
commandments.</p>

<p>We have known him, if we keep his commandments... &nbsp;He speaks of that
practical knowledge by love and affection, which can only be proved by
our keeping his commandments; and without which we can not be said to
know God as we should do.</p>

<p>2:4. He who saith that he knoweth him and keepeth not his commandments
is a liar: and the truth is not in him.</p>

<p>2:5. But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of
God is perfected. And by this we know that we are in him.</p>

<p>2:6. He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as
he walked.</p>

<p>2:7. Dearly beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but an old
commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the
word which you have heard.</p>

<p>2:8. Again a new commandment I write unto you: which thing is true both
in him and in you, because the darkness is passed and the true light now
shineth.</p>

<p>A new commandment... Viz., the commandment of love, which was first
given in the old law; but was renewed and extended by Christ. &nbsp;See John
13.34.</p>

<p>2:9. He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in
darkness even until now.</p>

<p>2:10. He that loveth his brother abideth in the light: and there is no
scandal in him.</p>

<p>2:11. But he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in
darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth: because the darkness hath
blinded his eyes.</p>

<p>2:12. I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven
you for his name's sake.</p>

<p>2:13. I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him who is from
the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome
the wicked one.</p>

<p>2:14. I write unto you, babes, because you have known the Father. I
write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God
abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.</p>

<p>2:15. Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world. If any
man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.</p>

<p>2:16. For all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh and
the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life, which is not of the
Father but is of the world.</p>

<p>2:17. And the world passeth away and the concupiscence thereof: but he
that doth the will of God abideth for ever.</p>

<p>2:18. Little children, it is the last hour: and as you have heard that
Antichrist cometh, even now there are become many Antichrists: whereby
we know that it is the last hour.</p>

<p>It is the last hour... That is, it is the last age of the world. &nbsp;Many
Antichrists;... that is, many heretics, enemies of Christ and his
church, and forerunners of the great Antichrist.</p>

<p>2:19. They went out from us but they were not of us. For if they had
been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us: but that they may
be manifest, that they are not all of us.</p>

<p>They were not of us... That is, they were not solid, steadfast, genuine
Christians: otherwise they would have remained in the church.</p>

<p>2:20. But you have the unction from the Holy One and know all things.</p>

<p>The unction from the Holy One... That is, grace and wisdom from the Holy
Ghost. Know all things... The true children of God's church, remaining
in unity, under the guidance of their lawful pastors, partake of the
grace of the Holy Ghost, promised to the church and her pastors; and
have in the church all necessary knowledge and instruction; so as to
have no need to seek it elsewhere, since it can be only found in that
society of which they are members.</p>

<p>2:21. I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but
as to them that know it: and that no lie is of the truth.</p>

<p>2:22. Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? &nbsp;This
is Antichrist, who denieth the Father and the Son.</p>

<p>2:23. Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. He that
confesseth the Son hath the Father also.</p>

<p>2:24. As for you, let that which you have heard from the beginning abide
in you. If that abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning,
you also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.</p>

<p>2:25. And this is the promise which he hath promised us, life
everlasting.</p>

<p>2:26. These things have I written to you concerning them that seduce
you.</p>

<p>2:27. And as for you, let the unction, which you have received from him
abide in you. And you have no need that any man teach you: but as his
unction teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie. And as it
hath taught you, abide in him.</p>

<p>You have no need, etc... You want not to be taught by any of these men,
who, under pretence of imparting more knowledge to you, seek to seduce
you (ver. 26), since you are sufficiently taught already, and have all
knowledge and grace in the church, with the unction of the Holy Ghost;
which these new teachers have no share in.</p>

<p>2:28. And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear
we may have confidence and not be confounded by him at his coming.</p>

<p>2:29. If you know that he is just, know ye, that every one also who doth
justice is born of him.</p>

<p>1 John Chapter 3</p>

<p>Of the love of God to us. How we may distinguish the children of God and
those of the devil. Of loving one another and of purity of conscience.</p>

<p>3:1. Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us,
that we should be called and should be the sons of God. &nbsp;Therefore the
world knoweth not us, because it knew not him.</p>

<p>3:2. Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God: and it hath not yet
appeared what we shall be. We know that when he shall appear we shall be
like to him: because we shall see him as he is.</p>

<p>3:3. And every one that hath this hope in him sanctifieth himself, as he
also is holy.</p>

<p>3:4. Whosoever committeth sin committeth also iniquity. And sin is
iniquity.</p>

<p>Iniquity... transgression of the law.</p>

<p>3:5. And you know that he appeared to take away our sins: and in him
there is no sin.</p>

<p>3:6. Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: and whosoever sinneth hath
not seen him nor known him.</p>

<p>Sinneth not... viz., mortally. See chap. 1.8.</p>

<p>3:7. Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doth justice is
just, even as he is just.</p>

<p>3:8. He that committeth sin is of the devil: for the devil sinneth from
the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he might
destroy the works of the devil.</p>

<p>3:9. Whosoever is born of God committeth not sin: for his seed abideth
in him. And he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</p>

<p>Committeth not sin... That is, as long as he keepeth in himself this
seed of grace, and this divine generation, by which he is born of God.
But then he may fall from this happy state, by the abuse of his free
will, as appears from Rom. 11.20-22; Cor. 9.27; and 10.12; Phil. 2.12;
Apoc. 3.11.</p>

<p>3:10. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the
devil. Whosoever is not just is not of God, or he that loveth not his
brother.</p>

<p>3:11. For this is the declaration which you have heard from the
beginning, that you should love one another.</p>

<p>3:12. Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one and killed his brother.
And wherefore did he kill him? Because his own works were wicked: and
his brother's just.</p>

<p>3:13. Wonder not, brethren, if the world hate you.</p>

<p>3:14. We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love
the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.</p>

<p>3:15. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you know that no
murderer hath eternal life abiding in himself.</p>

<p>3:16. In this we have known the charity of God, because he hath laid
down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the
brethren.</p>

<p>3:17. He that hath the substance of this world and shall see his brother
in need and shall shut up his bowels from him: how doth the charity of
God abide in him?</p>

<p>3:18. My little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in
deed and in truth.</p>

<p>3:19. In this we know that we are of the truth and in his sight shall
persuade our hearts.</p>

<p>3:20. For if our heart reprehend us, God is greater than our heart and
knoweth all things.</p>

<p>3:21. Dearly beloved, if our heart do not reprehend us, we have
confidence towards God.</p>

<p>3:22. And whatsoever we shall ask, we shall receive of him: because we
keep his commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his
sight.</p>

<p>3:23. And this is his commandment: That we should believe in the name of
his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as he hath given commandment
unto us.</p>

<p>3:24. And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in
him. And in this we know that he abideth in us by the Spirit which he
hath given us.</p>

<p>1 John Chapter 4</p>

<p>What spirits are of God, and what are not. We must love one another,
because God has loved us.</p>

<p>4:1. Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if
they be of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</p>

<p>Try the spirits... Viz., by examining whether their teaching be
agreeable to the rule of the Catholic faith, and the doctrine of the
church. For as he says, (ver. 6,) He that knoweth God, heareth us [the
pastors of the church]. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the
spirit of error.</p>

<p>4:2. By this is the spirit of God known. Every spirit which confesseth
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:</p>

<p>Every spirit which confesseth, etc... Not that the confession of this
point of faith alone, is, at all times, and in all cases, sufficient;
but that with relation to that time, and for that part of the Christian
doctrine, which was then particularly to be confessed, taught, and
maintained against the heretics of those days, this was the most proper
token, by which the true teachers might be distinguished form the false.</p>

<p>4:3. And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus is not of God. And this is
Antichrist, of whom you have heard that he cometh: and he is now already
in the world.</p>

<p>That dissolveth Jesus... Viz., either by denying his humanity, or his
divinity. He is now already in the world... Not in his person, but in
his spirit, and in his precursors.</p>

<p>4:4. You are of God, little children, and have overcome him. &nbsp;Because
greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</p>

<p>4:5. They are of the world. Therefore of the world they speak: and the
world heareth them.</p>

<p>4:6. We are of God. He that knoweth God heareth us. He that is not of
God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit
of error.</p>

<p>4:7. Dearly beloved, let us love one another: for charity is of God. And
every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.</p>

<p>4:8. He that loveth not knoweth not God: for God is charity.</p>

<p>4:9. By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God
hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by him.</p>

<p>4:10. In this is charity: not as though we had loved God, but because he
hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.</p>

<p>4:11. My dearest, if God hath so loved us, we also ought to love one
another.</p>

<p>4:12. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God
abideth in us: and his charity is perfected in us.</p>

<p>4:13. In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us: because he
hath given us of his spirit.</p>

<p>4:14. And we have seen and do testify that the Father hath sent his Son
to be the Saviour of the world.</p>

<p>4:15. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth
in him, and he in God.</p>

<p>4:16. And we have known and have believed the charity which God hath to
us. God is charity: and he that abideth in charity abideth in God, and
God in him.</p>

<p>4:17. In this is the charity of God perfected with us, that we may have
confidence in the day of judgment: because as he is, we also are in this
world.</p>

<p>4:18. Fear is not in charity: but perfect charity casteth out fear,
because fear hath sin. And he that feareth is not perfected in charity.</p>

<p>Fear is not in charity, etc... Perfect charity, or love, banisheth human
fear, that is, the fear of men; as also all perplexing fear, which makes
men mistrust or despair of God's mercy; and that kind of servile fear,
which makes them fear the punishment of sin more than the offence
offered to God. But it no way excludes the wholesome fear of God's
judgments, so often recomended in holy writ; nor that fear and
trembling, with which we are told to work out our salvation. Phil. 2.12.</p>

<p>4:19. Let us therefore love God: because God first hath loved us.</p>

<p>4:20. If any man say: I love God, and hateth his brother; he is a liar.
For he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can he love God
whom he seeth not?</p>

<p>4:21. And this commandment we have from God, that he who loveth God love
also his brother.</p>

<p>1 John Chapter 5</p>

<p>Of them that are born of God, and of true charity. Faith overcomes the
world. Three that bear witness to Christ. Of faith in his name and of
sin that is and is not to death.</p>

<p>5:1. Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. &nbsp;And
every one that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him.</p>

<p>Is born of God... That is, is justified, and become a child of God by
baptism: which is also to be understood; provided the belief of this
fundamental article of the Christian faith be accompanied with all the
other conditions, which, by the word of God, and his appointment, are
also required to justification; such as a general belief of all that God
has revealed and promised: hope, love, repentance, and a sincere
disposition to keep God's holy law and commandments.</p>

<p>5:2. In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God
and keep his commandments.</p>

<p>5:3. For this is the charity of God: That we keep his commandments. &nbsp;And
his commandments are not heavy.</p>

<p>5:4. For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world. And this is the
victory which overcameth the world: Our faith.</p>

<p>Our faith... Not a bare, speculative, or dead faith; but a faith that
worketh by charity. Gal. 5.6</p>

<p>5:5. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that
Jesus is the Son of God?</p>

<p>5:6. This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water
only but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth that
Christ is the truth.</p>

<p>Came by water and blood... Not only to wash away our sins by the water
of baptism, but by his own blood.</p>

<p>5:7. And there are Three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the
Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one.</p>

<p>5:8. And there are three that give testimony on earth: the spirit and
the water and the blood. And these three are one.</p>

<p>The spirit, and the water, and the blood... As the Father, the Word, and
the Holy Ghost, all bear witness to Christ's divinity; so the spirit,
which he yielded up, crying out with a loud voice upon the cross; and
the water and blood that issued from his side, bear witness to his
humanity, and are one; that is, all agree in one testimony.</p>

<p>5:9. If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is
greater. For this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he
hath testified of his Son.</p>

<p>5:10. He that believeth in the Son of God hath the testimony of God in
himself. He that believeth not the Son maketh him a liar: because he
believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son.</p>

<p>He that believeth not the Son, etc... By refusing to believe the
testimonies given by the three divine persons, that Jesus was the
Messias, and the true Son of God, by whom eternal life is obtained and
promised to all that comply with his doctrine. In him we have also this
lively confidence, that we shall obtain whatever we ask, according to
his will, when we ask what is for our good, with perseverance, and in
the manner we ought. And this we know, and have experience of, by having
obtained the petitions that we have made.</p>

<p>5:11. And this is the testimony that God hath given to us eternal life.
And this life is in his Son.</p>

<p>5:12. He that hath the Son hath life. He that hath not the Son hath not
life.</p>

<p>5:13. These things I write to you that you may know that you have
eternal life: you who believe in the name of the Son of God.</p>

<p>5:14. And this is the confidence which we have towards him: That,
whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth us.</p>

<p>5:15. And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we know that we
have the petitions which we request of him.</p>

<p>5:16. He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death,
let him ask: and life shall be given to him who sinneth not to death.
There is a sin unto death. For that I say not that any man ask.</p>

<p>A sin which is not to death, etc... It is hard to determine what St.
John here calls a sin which is not to death, and a sin which is unto
death. The difference can not be the same as betwixt sins that are
called venial and mortal: for he says, that if a man pray for his
brother, who commits a sin that is not to death, life shall be given
him: therefore such a one had before lost the life of grace, and been
guilty of what is commonly called a mortal sin. &nbsp;And when he speaks of a
sin that is unto death, and adds these words, for that I say not that
any man ask, it cannot be supposed that St. John would say this of every
mortal sin, but only of some heinous sins, which are very seldom
remitted, because such sinners very seldom repent. By a sin therefore
which is unto death, interpreters commonly understand a wilfull apostasy
from the faith, and from the known truth, when a sinner, hardened by his
own ingratitude, becomes deaf to all admonitions, will do nothing for
himself, but runs on to a final impenitence. Nor yet does St. John say,
that such a sin is never remitted, or cannnot be remitted, but only has
these words, for that I say not that any man ask the remission: that
is, though we must pray for all sinners whatsoever, yet men can not pray
for such sinners with such a confidence of obtaining always their
petitions, as St. John said before, ver. 14. &nbsp;Whatever exposition we
follow on this verse, our faith teacheth us from the holy scriptures,
that God desires not the death of any sinner, but that he be converted
and live, Ezech. 33.11. Though men's sins be as red as scarlet, they
shall become as white as snow, Isa. 3.18. It is the will of God that
every one come to the knowledge of the truth, and be saved. There is no
sin so great but which God is willing to forgive, and has left a power
in his church to remit the most enormous sins: so that no sinner need
despair of pardon, nor will any sinner perist, but by his own fault. A
sin unto death... Some understand this of final impenitence, or of dying
in mortal sin; which is the only sin that never can be remitted. But, it
is probable, he may also comprise under this name, the sin of apostasy
from the faith, and some other such heinous sins as are seldom and
hardly remitted: and therefore he gives little encouragement, to such as
pray for these sinners, to expect what they ask.</p>

<p>5:17. All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto death.</p>

<p>5:18. We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not: but the
generation of God preserveth him and the wicked one toucheth him not.</p>

<p>5:19. We know that we are of God and the whole world is seated in
wickedness.</p>

<p>And the whole world is seated in wickedness... That is, a great part of
the world. It may also signify, is under the wicked one, meaning the
devil, who is elsewhere called the prince of this world, that is, of all
the wicked. John 12.31.</p>

<p>5:20. And we know that the Son of God is come. And he hath given us
understanding that we may know the true God and may be in his true Son.
This is the true God and life eternal.</p>

<p>And may be in his true Son. He is, or this is the true God, and life
eternal... Which words are a clear proof of Christ's divinity, and as
such made use of by the ancient fathers.</p>

<p>5:21. Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.</p>

<p>Keep yourselves from idols... An admonition to the newly converted

</p>
<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
