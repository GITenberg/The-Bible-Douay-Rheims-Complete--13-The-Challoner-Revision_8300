<p>THE THIRD BOOK OF KINGS</p>

<p>This and the following Book are called by the holy fathers the third and
fourth book of Kings; but by the Hebrews, the first and second. They
contain the history of the kingdoms of Israel and Juda, from the
beginning of the reign of Solomon, to the captivity. As to the writer of
these books, it seems most probable they were not written by one man;
nor at one time; but as there was all along a succession of prophets in
Israel, who recorded, by divine inspiration, the most remarkable things
that happened in their days, these books seem to have been written by
these prophets. See 2 Paralip. alias 2 Chron. 9.29; 12.15; 13.22; 20.34;
26.22; 32.32.</p>

<p>
3 Kings Chapter 1</p>

<p>King David growing old, Abisag a Sunamitess is brought to him. Adonias
pretending to reign, Nathan and Bethsabee obtain that Solomon should be
declared and anointed king.</p>

<p>1:1. Now king David was old, and advanced in years: and when he was
covered with clothes he was not warm.</p>

<p>1:2. His servants therefore, said to him: Let us seek for our Lord the
king, a young virgin, and let her stand before the king, and cherish
him, and sleep in his bosom and warm our lord the king.</p>

<p>1:3. So they sought a beautiful young woman, in all the coasts of Israel
and they found Abisag, a Sunamitess, and brought her to the king.</p>

<p>1:4. And the damsel was exceedingly beautiful, and she slept with the
king, and served him, but the king did not know her.</p>

<p>1:5. And Adonias, the son of Haggith, exalted himself, saying: I will be
king. &nbsp;And he made himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run
before him.</p>

<p>1:6. Neither did his father rebuke him at any time, saying: Why hast
thou done this? &nbsp;And he also was very beautiful, the next in birth after
Absalom.</p>

<p>1:7. And he conferred with Joab, the son of Sarvia, and with Abiathar,
the priest, who furthered Adonias's side.</p>

<p>1:8. But Sadoc, the priest, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and Nathan,
the prophet, and Semei, and Rei, and the strength of David's army, was
not with Adonias.</p>

<p>1:9. And Adonias having slain rams and calves, and all fat cattle, by
the stone of Zoheleth, which was near the fountain Rogel, invited all
his brethren, the king's sons, and all the men of Juda, the king's
servants:</p>

<p>1:10. But Nathan, the prophet, and Banaias, and all the valiant men, and
Solomon, his brother, he invited not.</p>

<p>1:11. And Nathan said to Bethsabee, the mother of Solomon: Hast thou not
heard that Adonias, the son of Haggith, reigneth, and our lord David
knoweth it not?</p>

<p>1:12. Now then, come, take my counsel, and save thy life, and the life
of thy son Solomon.</p>

<p>1:13. Go, and get thee in to king David, and say to him: Didst not thou,
my lord, O king, swear to me, thy handmaid, saying: Solomon, thy son,
shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then doth
Adonias reign?</p>

<p>1:14. And while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I will come
in after thee, and will fill up thy words.</p>

<p>1:15. So Bethsabee went in to the king into the chamber. Now the king
was very old, and Abisag, the Sunamitess, ministered to him.</p>

<p>1:16. Bethsabee bowed herself, and worshipped the king. And the king
said to her: What is thy will?</p>

<p>1:17. She answered, and said: My lord, thou didst swear to thy handmaid,
by the Lord thy God, saying: Solomon, thy son, shall reign after me, and
he shall sit on my throne.</p>

<p>1:18. And behold, now Adonias reigneth, and thou, my lord the king,
knowest nothing of it.</p>

<p>1:19. He hath killed oxen, and all fat cattle, and many rams, and
invited all the king's sons, and Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the
general of the army: but Solomon, thy servant, he invited not.</p>

<p>1:20. And now, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee,
that thou shouldst tell them, who shall sit on thy throne, my lord the
king, after thee.</p>

<p>1:21. Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king sleepeth
with his fathers, that I, and my son, Solomon, shall be accounted
offenders.</p>

<p>1:22. As she was yet speaking with the king, Nathan, the prophet, came.</p>

<p>1:23. And they told the king, saying: Nathan, the prophet, is here. And
when he was come in before the king, and had worshipped, bowing down to
the ground,</p>

<p>1:24. Nathan said: My lord, O king, hast thou said: Let Adonias reign
after me, and let him sit upon my throne?</p>

<p>1:25. Because he is gone down to day, and hath killed oxen, and
fatlings, and many rams, and invited all the king's sons, and the
captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest: and they are eating and
drinking before him, and saying: God save king Adonias:</p>

<p>1:26. But me, thy servant, and Sadoc, the priest, and Banaias, the son
of Joiada, and Solomon, thy servant, he hath not invited.</p>

<p>1:27. Is this word come out from my lord the king, and hast thou not
told me, thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king
after him?</p>

<p>1:28. And king David answered, and said: Call to me Bethsabee. And when
she was come in to the king, and stood before him,</p>

<p>1:29. The king swore, and said: As the Lord liveth, who hath delivered
my soul out of all distress,</p>

<p>1:30. Even as I swore to thee, by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying:
Solomon thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne
in my stead, so will I do this day.</p>

<p>1:31. And Bethsabee, bowing with her face to the earth, worshipped the
king, saying: May my lord David live for ever.</p>

<p>1:32. King David also said: Call me Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the
prophet, and Banaias, the son of Joiada. &nbsp;And when they were come in
before the king,</p>

<p>1:33. He said to them: Take with you the servants of your lord, and set
my son Solomon upon my mule: and bring him to Gihon:</p>

<p>1:34. And let Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, anoint him
there king over Israel: and you shall sound the trumpet, and shall say:
God save king Solomon.</p>

<p>1:35. And you shall come up after him, and he shall come, and shall sit
upon my throne, and he shall reign in my stead: and I will appoint him
to be ruler over Israel, and over Juda.</p>

<p>1:36. And Banaias, the son of Joiada, answered the king, saying: Amen:
so say the Lord, the God of my lord the king.</p>

<p>1:37. As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, so be he with
Solomon, and make his throne higher than the throne of my lord king
David.</p>

<p>1:38. So Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, went down, and
Banaias, the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and Phelethi: and they set
Solomon upon the mule of king David, and brought him to Gihon.</p>

<p>1:39. And Sadoc, the priest, took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle,
and anointed Solomon: and they sounded the trumpet, and all the people
said: God save king Solomon.</p>

<p>1:40. And all the multitude went up after him, and the people played
with pipes, and rejoiced with a great joy, and the earth rang with the
noise of their cry.</p>

<p>1:41. And Adonias, and all that were invited by him, heard it, and now
the feast was at an end. Joab also, hearing the sound of the trumpet,
said: What meaneth this noise of the city in an uproar?</p>

<p>1:42. While he yet spoke, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar, the priest,
came: and Adonias said to him: Come in, because thou art a valiant man,
and bringest good news.</p>

<p>1:43. And Jonathan answered Adonias: Not so: for our lord, king David,
hath appointed Solomon king;</p>

<p>1:44. And hath sent with him Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet,
and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and
they have set him upon the king's mule:</p>

<p>1:45. And Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, have anointed him
king, in Gihon: and they are gone up from thence rejoicing, so that the
city rang again: this is the noise that you have heard.</p>

<p>1:46. Moreover, Solomon sitteth upon the throne of the kingdom.</p>

<p>1:47. And the king's servants going in, have blessed ouur lord king
David, saying: May God make the name of Solomon greater than thy name,
and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king adored in his
bed:</p>

<p>1:48. And he said: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who hath
given this day one to sit on my throne, my eyes seeing it.</p>

<p>1:49. Then all the guests of Adonias were afraid, and they all arose,
and every man went his way.</p>

<p>1:50. And Adonias fearing Solomon, arose and went, and took hold of the
horn of the altar.</p>

<p>1:51. And they told Solomon, saying: Behold Adonias fearing king
Solomon, hath taken hold of the horn of the altar, saying: Let king
Solomon swear to me this day, that he will not kill his servant with the
sword.</p>

<p>1:52. And Solomon said: If he be a good man, there shall not so much as
one hair of his head fall to the ground: but if evil be found in him, he
shall die.</p>

<p>1:53. Then king Solomon sent, and brought him out from the altar: and
going in, he worshipped king Solomon: and Solomon said to him: Go to thy
house.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 2</p>

<p>David, after giving his last charge to Solomon, dieth. Adonias is put to
death: Abiathar is banished: Joab and Semei are slain.</p>

<p>1:1. And the days of David drew nigh that he should die, and he charged
his son Solomon, saying:</p>

<p>2:2. I am going the way of all flesh: take thou courage and shew thyself
a man.</p>

<p>2:3. And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and
observe his ceremonies, and his precepts, and judgments, and
testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses: that thou mayst
understand all thou dost, and whithersoever thou shalt turn thyself:</p>

<p>2:4. That the Lord may confirm his words, which he hath spoken of me,
saying: If thy children shall take heed to their ways, and shall walk
before me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, there
shall not be taken away from thee a man on the throne of Israel.</p>

<p>2:5. Thou knowest also what Joab, the son of Sarvia, hath done to me,
what he did to the two captains of the army of Israel, to Abner, the son
of Ner, and to Amasa, the son of Jether: whom he slew, and shed the
blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle that was
about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</p>

<p>Joab... These instructions given by David to his son, with relation to
Joab and Semei, proceeded not from any rancour of heart, or private
pique; but from a zeal for justice, that crimes so public and heinous
might not pass unpunished.</p>

<p>2:6. Do, therefore, according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head
go down to hell in peace.</p>

<p>To hell... This word hell doth not here signify the place or state of
damnation; but the place and state of the dead.</p>

<p>2:7. But shew kindness to the sons of Berzellai, the Galaadite, and let
them eat at thy table: for they met me when I fled from the face of
Absalom, thy brother.</p>

<p>2:8. Thou hast also with thee Semei, the son of Gera, the son of Jemini,
of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse, when I went to the
camp: but because he came down to meet me when I passed over the Jordan,
and I swore to him by the Lord, saying: I will not kill thee with the
sword:</p>

<p>2:9. Do not thou hold him guiltless. But thou art a wise man, and
knowest what to do with him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs
with blood to the grave.</p>

<p>2:10. So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
David.</p>

<p>2:11. And the days that David reigned in Israel, were forty years: in
Hebron he reigned seven years, in Jerusalem thirty-three.</p>

<p>2:12. And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and his
kingdom was strengthened exceedingly.</p>

<p>2:13. And Adonias, the son of Haggith, came to Bethsabee the mother of
Solomon. And she said to him: Is thy coming peaceable? He answered: It
is peaceable.</p>

<p>2:14. And he added: I have a word to speak with thee. She said to him:
Speak. And he said:</p>

<p>2:15. Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had
preferred me to be their king: but the kingdom is transferred, and is
become my brother's: for it was appointed him by the Lord.</p>

<p>2:16. Now therefore, I ask one petition of thee; turn not away my face.
And she said to him: Say on.</p>

<p>2:17. And he said I pray thee speak to king Solomon (for he cannot deny
thee any thing) to give me Abisag, the Sunamitess, to wife.</p>

<p>2:18. And Bethsabee said: Well, I will speak for thee to the king.</p>

<p>2:19. Then Bethsabee came to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonias:
and the king arose to meet her, and bowed to her, and sat down upon his
throne: and a throne was set for the king's mother, and she sat on his
right hand.</p>

<p>2:20. And she said to him: I desire one small petition of thee; do not
put me to confusion. And the king said to her: My mother ask, for I must
not turn away thy face.</p>

<p>2:21. And she said: Let Abisag, the Sunamitess, be given to Adonias, thy
brother, to wife.</p>

<p>2:22. And king Solomon answered, and said to his mother: Why dost thou
ask Abisag, the Sunamitess, for Adonias? ask for him also the kingdom;
for he is my elder brother, and hath Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the
son of Sarvia.</p>

<p>2:23. Then king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying: So and so may God do
to me, and add more, if Adonias hath not spoken this word against his
own life.</p>

<p>2:24. And now, as the Lord liveth, who hath established me, and placed
me upon the throne of David, my father, and who hath made me a house, as
he promised, Adonias shall be put to death this day.</p>

<p>2:25. And king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaias, the son of Joiada,
who slew him, and he died.</p>

<p>2:26. And the king said also to Abiathar, the priest: Go to Anathoth, to
thy lands, for indeed thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this
time put thee to death, because thou didst carry the ark of the Lord God
before David, my father, and hast endured trouble in all the troubles my
father endured.</p>

<p>2:27. So Solomon cast out Abiathar from being the priest of the Lord,
that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning
the house of Heli in Silo.</p>

<p>2:28. And the news came to Joab, because Joab had turned after Adonias,
and had not turned after Solomon: and Joab fled into the tabernacle of
the Lord, and took hold on the horn of the altar.</p>

<p>2:29. And it was told king Solomon, that Joab was fled into the
tabernacle of the Lord, and was by the altar: and Solomon sent Banaias,
the son of Joiada, saying. Go, kill him.</p>

<p>2:30. And Banaias came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him:
Thus saith the king: Come forth. And he said: I will not come forth, but
here I will die. Banaias brought word back to the king, saying: Thus
saith Joab, and thus he answered me.</p>

<p>2:31. And the king said to him: Do as he hath said; and kill him, and
bury him, and thou shalt remove the innocent blood which hath been shed
by Joab, from me, and from the house of my father:</p>

<p>2:32. And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head; because he
murdered two men, just and better than himself: and slew them with the
sword, my father, David, not knowing it; Abner, the son of Ner, general
of the army of Israel, and Amasa, the son of Jether general of the army
of Juda;</p>

<p>2:33. And their blood shall return upon the head of Joab, and upon the
head of his seed for ever. But to David and his seed, and his house, and
to his throne, be peace for ever from the Lord.</p>

<p>2:34. So Banaias, the son of Joiada, went up, and setting upon him slew
him, and he was buried in his house in the desert.</p>

<p>2:35. And the king appointed Banaias, the son of Joiada in his room over
the army; and Sadoc, the priest, he put in the place of Abiathar.</p>

<p>2:36. The king also sent, and called for Semei, and said to him: Build
thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there: and go not out from thence
any where.</p>

<p>2:37. For on what day soever thou shalt go out, and shalt pass over the
brook Cedron, know that thou shalt be put to death: thy blood shall be
upon thy own head.</p>

<p>2:38. And Semei said to the king: The saying is good: as my lord the
king hath said, so will thy servant do. &nbsp;And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem
many days.</p>

<p>2:39. And it came to pass after three years, that the servants of Semei
ran away to Achis, the son of Maacha, the king of Geth: and it was told
Semei that his servants were gone to Geth.</p>

<p>2:40. And Semei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Achis, to Geth,
to seek his servants, and he brought them out of Geth.</p>

<p>2:41. And it was told Solomon, that Semei had gone from Jerusalem to
Geth, and was come back.</p>

<p>2:42. And sending he called for him, and said to him: Did I not protest
to thee by the Lord, and tell thee before: On what day soever thou shalt
go out and walk abroad any where, know that thou shalt die? &nbsp;And thou
answeredst me: The word that I have heard is good.</p>

<p>2:43. Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the
commandment that I laid upon thee?</p>

<p>2:44. And the king said to Semei: Thou knowest all the evil, of which
thy heart is conscious, which thou didst to David, my father: the Lord
hath returned thy wickedness upon thy own head.</p>

<p>2:45. And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall
be established before the Lord for ever.</p>

<p>2:46. So the king commanded Banaias, the son of Joiada: and he went out
and struck him; and he died.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 3</p>

<p>Solomon marrieth Pharao's daughter. He sacrificeth in Gabaon: in the
choice which God gave him he preferreth wisdom. His wise judgment
between the two harlots.</p>

<p>3:1. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon, and he made
affinity with Pharao, the king of Egypt: for he took his daughter, and
brought her into the city of David: until he had made an end of building
his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem
round about.</p>

<p>3:2. But yet the people sacrificed in the high places: for there was no
temple built to the name of the Lord until that day.</p>

<p>High places... That is, altars where they worshipped the Lord, but not
according to the ordinance of the law; which allowed of no other places
for sacrifice but the temple of God. Among these high places that of
Gabaon was the chiefest, because there was the tabernacle of the
testimony, which had been removed from Silo to Nobe and from Nobe to
Gabaon.</p>

<p>3:3. And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the precepts of David, his
father; only he sacrificed in the high places, and burnt incense.</p>

<p>3:4. He went therefore to Gabaon, to sacrifice there: for that was the
great high place: a thousand victims for holocausts, did Solomon offer
upon that altar, in Gabaon.</p>

<p>3:5. And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, saying: Ask
what thou wilt that I should give thee.</p>

<p>3:6. And Solomon said: Thou hast shewed great mercy to thy servant
David, my father, even as he walked before thee in truth, and justice,
and an upright heart with thee: and thou hast kept thy great mercy for
him, and hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.</p>

<p>3:7. And now, O Lord God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of
David, my father: and I am but a child, and know not how to go out and
come in;</p>

<p>3:8. And thy servant is in the midst of the people which thou hast
chosen, an immense people, which cannot be numbered nor counted for
multitude.</p>

<p>3:9. Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart, to judge thy
people, and discern between good and evil. For who shall be able to
judge this people, thy people, which is so numerous?</p>

<p>3:10. And the word was pleasing to the Lord, that Solomon had asked such
a thing.</p>

<p>3:11. And the Lord said to Solomon: Because thou hast asked this thing,
and hast not asked for thyself long life nor riches, nor the lives of
thy enemies, but hast asked for thyself wisdom to discern jndgment;</p>

<p>3:12. Behold I have done for thee according to thy words, and have given
thee a wise and understanding heart, in so much that there hath been no
one like thee before thee, nor shall arise after thee.</p>

<p>3:13. Yea, and the things also which thou didst not ask, I have given
thee; to wit, riches and glory: so that no one hath been like thee among
the kings in all days heretofore.</p>

<p>3:14. And if thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my precepts and my
commandments, as thy father walked, I will lengthen thy days.</p>

<p>3:15. And Solomon awaked, and perceived that it was a dream: and when he
was come to Jerusalem, he stood before the ark of the covenant of the
Lord, and offered holocausts, and sacrificed victims of peace offerings,
and made a great feast for all his servants.</p>

<p>3:16. Then there came two women that were harlots, to the king, and
stood before him.</p>

<p>3:17. And one of them said: I beseech thee, my lord, I and this woman
dwelt in one house, and I was delivered of a child with her in the
chamber.</p>

<p>3:18. And the third day after I was delivered, she also was delivered;
and we were together, and no other person with us in the house; only we
two.</p>

<p>3:19. And this woman's child died in the night: for in her sleep she
overlaid him.</p>

<p>3:20. And rising in the dead time of the night, she took my child from
my side, while I, thy handmaid, was asleep, and laid it in her bosom:
and laid her dead child in my bosom.</p>

<p>3:21. And when I arose in the morning, to give my child suck, behold it
was dead: but considering him more diligently, when it was clear day, I
found that it was not mine which I bore.</p>

<p>3:22. And the other woman answered: It is not so as thou sayst, but thy
child is dead, and mine is alive. On the contrary, she said; Thou liest:
for my child liveth, and thy child is dead. And in this manner they
strove before the king.</p>

<p>3:23. Then said the king: The one saith, My child is alive, and thy
child is dead. And the other answereth: Nay; but thy child is dead, and
mine liveth.</p>

<p>3:24. The king therefore said: Bring me a sword. And when they had
brought a sword before the king,</p>

<p>3:25. Divide, said he, the living child in two, and give half to the one
and half to the other.</p>

<p>3:26. But the woman, whose child was alive, said to the king; (for her
bowels were moved upon her child) I beseech thee, my lord, give her the
child alive, and do not kill it. But the other said: Let it be neither
mine nor thine; but divide it.</p>

<p>3:27. The king answered, and said: Give the living child to this woman,
and let it not be killed; for she is the mother thereof.</p>

<p>3:28. And all Israel heard the judgment which the king had judged, and
they feared the king, seeing that the wisdom of God was in him to do
judgment.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 4</p>

<p>Solomon's chief officers. His riches and wisdom.</p>

<p>4:1. And king Solomon reigned over all Israel:</p>

<p>4:2. And these were the princes which he had: Azarias, the son of Sadoc,
the priest:</p>

<p>4:3. Elihoreph, and Ahia, the sons of Sisa, scribes: Josaphat, the son
of Ahilud, recorder:</p>

<p>4:4. Banaias, the son of Joiada, over the army: and Sadoc, and Abiathar,
priests.</p>

<p>Abiathar... By this it appears that Abiathar was not altogether deposed
from the high priesthood; but only banished to his country house, and by
that means excluded from the exercise of his functions.</p>

<p>4:5. Azarias, the son of Nathan, over them that were about the king:
Zabud, the son of Nathan, the priest, the king's friend:</p>

<p>4:6. And Ahisar, governor of the house: and Adoniram, the son of Abda,
over the tribute.</p>

<p>4:7. And Solomon had twelve governors over all Israel, who provided
victuals for the king and for his house hold: for every one provided
necessaries, each man his month in the year.</p>

<p>4:8. And these are their names: Benhur, in mount Ephraim.</p>

<p>4:9. Bendecar, in Macces, and in Salebim, and in Bethsames, and in Elon,
and in Bethanan.</p>

<p>4:10. Benhesed, in Aruboth: his was Socho, and all the land of Epher.</p>

<p>4:11. Benabinadab, to whom belonged all Nephath-Dor: he had Tapheth, the
daughter of Solomon, to wife.</p>

<p>4:12. Bana, the son of Ahilud, who governed Thanac, and Mageddo, and all
Bethsan, which is by Sarthana, beneath Jezrael, from Bethsan unto
Abelmehula, over against Jecmaan.</p>

<p>4:13. Bengaber, in Ramoth Galaad: he had the town of Jair, the son of
Manasses, in Galaad: he was chief in all the country of Argob, which is
in Basan, threescore great cities with walls, and brazen bolts.</p>

<p>4:14. Ahinadab, the son of Addo, was chief in Manaim.</p>

<p>4:15. Achimaas, in Nephthali: he also had Basemath, the daughter of
Solomon, to wife.</p>

<p>4:16. Baana, the son of Husi, in Aser, and in Baloth.</p>

<p>4:17. Josaphat, the son of Pharue, in Issachar.</p>

<p>4:18. Semei, the son of Ela, in Benjamin.</p>

<p>4:19. Gaber, the son of Uri, in the land of Galaad, in the land of
Sehon, the king of the Amorrhites, and of Og, the king of Basan, over
all that were in that land.</p>

<p>4:20. Juda and Israel were innumerable, as the sand of the sea in
multitude; eating and drinking, and rejoicing.</p>

<p>4:21. And Solomon had under him all the kingdoms, from the river to the
land of the Philistines, even to the border of Egypt: and they brought
him presents, and served him all the days of his life.</p>

<p>The river... Euphrates.</p>

<p>4:22. And the provision of Solomon, for each day, was thirty measures of
fine flour, and threescore measures of meal;</p>

<p>4:23. Ten fat oxen, and twenty out of the pastures, and a hundred rams;
besides venison of harts, roes, and buffles, and fatted fowls.</p>

<p>4:24. For he had all the country which was beyond the river, from
Thaphsa to Gazan, and all the kings of those countries: and he had peace
on every side round about.</p>

<p>4:25. And Juda, and Israel, dwelt without any fear, every one under his
vine, and under his fig tree, from Dan to Bersabee, all the days of
Solomon.</p>

<p>4:26. And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of chariot horses, and
twelve thousand for the saddle.</p>

<p>4:27. And the foresaid governors of the king fed them; and they
furnished the necessaries also for king Solomon's table, with great
care, in their time.</p>

<p>4:28. They brought barley also, and straw for the horses and beasts, to
the place where the king was, according as it was appointed them.</p>

<p>4:29. And God gave to Solomon wisdom, and understanding exceeding much,
and largeness of heart, as the sand that is on the sea shore.</p>

<p>4:30. And the wisdom of Solomon surpassed the wisdom of all the
Orientals, and of the Egyptians;</p>

<p>4:31. And he was wiser than all men: wiser than Ethan, the Ezrahite, and
Heman, and Chalcol, and Dorda, the sons of Mahol, and he was renowned in
all nations round about.</p>

<p>4:32. Solomon also spoke three thousand parables: and his poems were a
thousand and five.</p>

<p>Three thousand parables, etc... These works are all lost, excepting some
part of the parables extant in the book of Proverbs; and his chief poem
called the Canticle of Canticles.</p>

<p>4:33. And he treated about trees, from the cedar that is in Libanus,
unto the hyssop that cometh out of the wall: and he discoursed of
beasts, and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of fishes.</p>

<p>4:34. And they came from all nations to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and
from all the kings of the earth, who heard of his wisdom.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 5</p>

<p>Hiram king of Tyre agreeth to furnish timber and workmen for building
the temple: the number of workmen and overseers.</p>

<p>5:1. And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent his servants to Solomon: for he heard
that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram had
always been David's friend.</p>

<p>5:2. Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:</p>

<p>5:3. Thou knowest the will of David, my father, and that he could not
build a house to the name of the Lord his God, because of the wars that
were round about him, until the Lord put them under the soles of his
feet.</p>

<p>5:4. But now the Lord my God hath given me rest round about; and there
is no adversary nor evil occurrence.</p>

<p>5:5. Wherefore I purpose to build a temple to the name of the Lord my
God, as the Lord spoke to David my father, saying: Thy son, whom I will
set upon the throne, in thy place, he shall build a house to my name.</p>

<p>5:6. Give orders, therefore, that thy servants cut me down cedar trees,
out of Libanus, and let my servants be with thy servants: and I will
give thee the hire of thy servants whatsoever thou wilt ask: for thou
knowest how there is not among my people a man that has skill to hew
wood like to the Sidonians.</p>

<p>5:7. Now when Hiram had heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced
exceedingly, and said: Blessed be the Lord God this day, who hath given
to David a very wise son over this numerous people.</p>

<p>5:8. And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: I have heard all thou hast
desired of me; and I will do all thy desire concerning cedar trees, and
fir trees.</p>

<p>5:9. My servants shall bring them down from Libanus to the sea: and I
will put them together in floats, on the sea, and convey them to the
place, which thou shalt signify to me, and will land them there, and
thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt allow me necessaries to furnish
food for my household.</p>

<p>5:10. So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees, and fir trees, according to all
his desire.</p>

<p>5:11. And Solomon allowed Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat, for
provision for his house, and twenty measures of the purest oil: thus
gave Solomon to Hiram every year.</p>

<p>5:12. And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon, as he promised him: and there
was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they two made a league
together.</p>

<p>5:13. And king Solomon chose workmen out of all Israel, and the levy was
of thirty thousand men.</p>

<p>5:14. And he sent them to Libanus, ten thousand every month, by turns,
so that two months they were at home: and Adoniram was over this levy.</p>

<p>5:15. And Solomon had seventy thousand to carry burdens, and eighty
thousand to hew stones in the mountain:</p>

<p>5:16. Besides the overseers who were over every work, in number three
thousand and three hundred, that ruled over the people, and them that
did the work.</p>

<p>5:17. And the king commanded that they should bring great stones, costly
stones, for the foundation of the temple, and should square them:</p>

<p>5:18. And the masons of Solomon, and the masons of Hiram, hewed them:
and the Giblians prepared timber and stones to build the house.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 6</p>

<p>The building of Solomon's temple.</p>

<p>6:1. And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after
the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year
of the reign of Solomon over Israel, in the month Zio, (the same is the
second month) he began to build a house to the Lord.</p>

<p>6:2. And the house, which king Solomon built to the Lord, was threescore
cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and thirty cubits in
height.</p>

<p>6:3. And there was a porch before the temple, of twenty cubits in
length, according to the measure of the breadth of the temple: and it
was ten cubits in breadth, before the face of the temple.</p>

<p>6:4. And he made in the temple oblique windows.</p>

<p>6:5. And upon the wall of the temple, he built floors round about, in
the walls of the house, round about the temple and the oracle, and he
made chambers in the sides round about.</p>

<p>Upon the wall, i. e., joining to the wall.-Ibid. He built floors round
about... Chambers or cells adjoining to the temple, for the use of the
temple and of the priests, so contrived as to be between the inward and
outward wall of the temple, in three stories, one above another.-Ibid.
The oracle... The inner temple or holy of holies, where God gave his
oracles.</p>

<p>6:6. The floor that was underneath was five cubits in breadth, and the
middle floor was six cubits in breadth, and the third floor was seven
cubits in breadth. And he put beams in the house round about on the
outside, that they might not be fastened in the walls of the temple.</p>

<p>6:7. And the house, when it was in building, was built of stones, hewed
and made ready: so that there was neither hammer nor axe, nor any tool
of iron heard in the house when it was in building.</p>

<p>Made ready, etc... So the stones for the building of God's eternal
temple in the heavenly Jerusalem, (who are the faithful,) must first be
hewn and polished here by many trials and sufferings, before they can be
admitted to have a place in that celestial structure.</p>

<p>6:8. The door, for the middle side, was on the right hand of the house:
and by winding stairs they went up to the middle room, and from the
middle to the third.</p>

<p>6:9. So he built the house, and finished it: and he covered the house
with roofs of cedar.</p>

<p>6:10. And he built a floor over all the house, five cubits in height,
and he covered the house with timber of cedar.</p>

<p>6:11. And the word of the Lord came to Solomon,</p>

<p>6:12. As for this house, which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in
my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments,
walking in them, I will fulfil my word to thee, which I spoke to David
thy father.</p>

<p>6:13. And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and I
will not forsake my people Israel.</p>

<p>6:14. So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</p>

<p>6:15. And he built the walls of the house on the inside, with boards of
cedar, from the floor of the house to the top of the walls, and to the
roofs, he covered it with boards of cedar on the inside: and he covered
the floor of the house with planks of fir.</p>

<p>6:16. And he built up twenty cubits with boards of cedar at the hinder
part of the temple, from the floor to the top: and made the inner house
of the oracle to be the holy of holies.</p>

<p>6:17. And the temple itself, before the doors of the oracle, was forty
cubits long.</p>

<p>6:18. And all the house was covered within with cedar, having the
turnings, and the joints thereof artfully wrought, and carvings
projecting out: all was covered with boards of cedar: and no stone could
be seen in the wall at all.</p>

<p>6:19. And he made the oracle in the midst of the house, in the inner
part, to set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord.</p>

<p>6:20. Now the oracle was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in
breadth, and twenty cubits in height. And he covered it, and overlaid it
with most pure gold. And the altar also he covered with cedar.</p>

<p>6:21. And the house before the oracle he overlaid with most pure gold,
and fastened on the plates with nails of gold.</p>

<p>6:22. And there was nothing in the temple that was not covered with
gold: the whole altar of the oracle he covered also with gold.</p>

<p>6:23. And he made in the oracle two cherubims of olive tree, of ten
cubits in height.</p>

<p>6:24. One wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing of the
cherub was five cubits: that is, in all ten cubits, from the extremity
of one wing to the extremity of the other wing.</p>

<p>6:25. The second cherub also was ten cubits: and the measure, and the
work was the same in both the cherubims:</p>

<p>6:26. That is to say, one cherub was ten cubits high, and in like manner
the other cherub.</p>

<p>6:27. And he set the cherubims in the midst of the inner temple: and the
cherubims stretched forth their wings, and the wing of the one touched
one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall: and
the other wings in the midst of the temple touched one another.</p>

<p>6:28. And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</p>

<p>6:29. And all the walls of the temple round about he carved with divers
figures and carvings: and he made in them cherubims and palm trees, and
divers representations, as it were standing out, and coming forth from
the wall.</p>

<p>6:30. And the floor of the house he also overlaid with gold within and
without.</p>

<p>6:31. And in the entrance of the oracle, he made little doors of olive
tree, and posts of five corners,</p>

<p>6:32. And two doors of olive tree: and he carved upon them figures of
cherubims, and figures of palm trees, and carvings very much projecting;
and he overlaid them with gold: and he covered both the cherubims and
the palm trees, and the other things, with gold.</p>

<p>6:33. And he made in the entrance of the temple posts of olive tree
foursquare:</p>

<p>6:34. And two doors of fir tree, one of each side: and each door was
double, and so opened with folding leaves.</p>

<p>6:35. And he carved cherubims, and palm trees, and carved work standing
very much out: and he overlaid all with golden plates in square work by
rule.</p>

<p>6:36. And he built the inner court with three rows of polished stones,
and one row of beams of cedar.</p>

<p>6:37. In the fourth year was the house of the Lord founded, in the month
Zio:</p>

<p>6:38. And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul. &nbsp;(which is the eighth
month) the house was finished in all the works thereof, and in all the
appurtenances thereof: and he was seven years in building it.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 7</p>

<p>Solomons palace, his house in the forest, and the queen's house: the
work of the two pillars: the sea (or laver) and other vessels.</p>

<p>7:1. And Solomon built his own house in thirteen years, and brought it
to perfection.</p>

<p>7:2. He built also the house of the forest of Libanus; the length of it
was a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits, and the height
thirty cubits: and four galleries between pillars of cedar: for he had
cut cedar trees into pillars.</p>

<p>7:3. And he covered the whole vault with boards of cedar, and it was
held up with five and forty pillars. &nbsp;And one row had fifteen pillars,</p>

<p>7:4. Set one against another,</p>

<p>7:5. And looking one upon another, with equal space between the pillars,
and over the pillars were square beams in all things equal.</p>

<p>7:6. And he made a porch of pillars of fifty cubits in length, and
thirty cubits in breadth: and another porch before the greater porch,
and pillars, and chapiters upon the pillars.</p>

<p>7:7. He made also the porch of the throne wherein is the seat of
judgment; and covered it with cedar wood from the floor to the top.</p>

<p>7:8. And in the midst of the porch, was a small house, where he sat in
judgment of the like work. He made also a house for the daughter of
Pharao (whom Solomon had taken to wife) of the same work, as this porch;</p>

<p>7:9. All of costly stones, which were sawed by a certain rule and
measure, both within and without: from the foundation to the top of the
walls, and without, unto the great court.</p>

<p>7:10. And the foundations were of costly stones, great stones of ten
cubits or eight cubits.</p>

<p>7:11. And above there were costly stones of equal measure hewed, and in
like manner planks of cedar.</p>

<p>7:12. And the great court was made round with three rows of hewed
stones, and one row of planks of cedar, which also was observed in the
inner court of the house of the Lord, and in the porch of the house.</p>

<p>7:13. And king Solomon sent, and brought Hiram from Tyre,</p>

<p>7:14. The son of a widow woman, of the tribe of Nephthali, whose father
was a Tyrian, an artificer in brass, and full of wisdom, and
understanding, and skill to work all work in brass. And when he was come
to king Solomon, he wrought all his work.</p>

<p>7:15. And he cast two pillars in brass, each pillar was eighteen cubits
high: and a line of twelve cubits compassed both the pillars.</p>

<p>7:16. He made also two chapiters of molten brass, to be set upon the
tops of the pillars: the height of one chapiter was five cubits, and the
height of the other chapiter was five cubits:</p>

<p>7:17. And a kind of network, and chain work wreathed together with
wonderful art. Both the chapiters of the pillars were cast: seven rows
of nets were on one chapiter, and seven nets on the other chapiter.</p>

<p>7:18. And he made the pillars, and two rows round about each network to
cover the chapiters, that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and in
like manner did he to the other chapiter.</p>

<p>7:19. And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars, were of
lily work, in the porch of four cubits.</p>

<p>7:20. And again there were other chapiters on the top of the pillars
above, according to the measure of the pillar over against the network:
and of pomegranates there were two hundred, in rows round about the
other chapiter.</p>

<p>7:21. And he set up the two pillars in the porch of the temple: and when
he had set up the pillar on the right hand, he called the name thereof
Jachin: in like manner he set up the second pillar, and called the name
thereof Booz.</p>

<p>Jachin... That is, firmly established.-Ibid. Booz... That is, in its
strength. By recording these names in holy writ, the spirit of God would
have us understand the invincible firmness and strength of the pillars
on which the true temple of God, which is the church, is established.</p>

<p>7:22. And upon the tops of the pillars he made lily work: so the work of
the pillars was finished.</p>

<p>7:23. He made also a molten sea, of ten cubits, from brim to brim, round
all about; the height of it was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits
compassed it round about.</p>

<p>7:24. And a graven work, under the brim of it, compassed it for ten
cubits going about the sea: there were two rows cast of chamfered
sculptures.</p>

<p>7:25. And it stood upon twelve oxen, of which three looked towards the
north, and three towards the west, and three towards the south, and
three towards the east: and the sea was above upon them, and their
hinder parts were all hid within.</p>

<p>7:26. And the laver was a hand breadth thick: and the brim thereof was
like the brim of a cup, or the leaf of a crisped lily: it contained two
thousand bates.</p>

<p>Two thousand bates... That is, about ten thousand gallons. This was the
quantity of water which was usually put into it: but it was capable, if
brimful, of holding three thousand. See 2 Par. 4.5.</p>

<p>7:27. And he made ten bases of brass, every base was four cubits in
length, and four cubits in breadth, and three cubits high.</p>

<p>7:28. And the work itself of the bases, was intergraven: and there were
gravings between the joinings.</p>

<p>7:29. And between the little crowns and the ledges, were lions, and
oxen, and cherubims; and in the joinings likewise above: and under the
lions and oxen, as it were bands of brass hanging down.</p>

<p>7:30. And every base had four wheels, and axletrees of brass: and at the
four sides were undersetters, under the laver molten, looking one
against another.</p>

<p>7:31. The mouth also of the laver within, was in the top of the
chapiter: and that which appeared without, was of one cubit all round,
and together it was one cubit and a half: and in the corners of the
pillars were divers engravings: and the spaces between the pillars were
square, not round.</p>

<p>7:32. And the four wheels, which were at the four corners of the base,
were joined one to another under the base: the height of a wheel was a
cubit and a half.</p>

<p>7:33. And they were such wheels as are used to be made in a chariot: and
their axletrees, and spokes, and strakes, and naves, were all cast.</p>

<p>7:34. And the four undersetters, that were at every corner of each base,
were of the base itself, cast and joined together.</p>

<p>7:35. And on the top of the base, there was a round compass of half a
cubit, so wrought that the laver might be set thereon, having its
gravings, and divers sculptures of itself.</p>

<p>7:36. He engraved also in those plates, which were of brass, and in the
corners, cherubims, and lions, and palm trees, in likeness of a man
standing, so that they seemed not to be engraven, but added round about.</p>

<p>7:37. After this manner, he made ten bases, of one casting and measure,
and the like graving.</p>

<p>7:38. He made also ten lavers of brass: one laver contained four bates,
and was of four cubits: and upon every base, in all ten, he put as many
lavers.</p>

<p>7:39. And he set the ten bases, five on the right side of the temple,
and five on the left: and the sea he put on the right side of the
temple, over against the east southward.</p>

<p>7:40. And Hiram made cauldrons, and shovels, and basins, and finished
all the work of king Solomon in the temple of the Lord.</p>

<p>7:41. The two pillars and the two cords of the chapiters, upon the
chapiters of the pillars: and the two networks, to cover the two cords,
that were upon the top of the pillars.</p>

<p>7:42. And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks: two rows of
pomegranates for each network, to cover the cords of the chapiters,
which were upon the tops of the pillars.</p>

<p>7:43. And the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases.</p>

<p>7:44. And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea.</p>

<p>7:45. And the cauldrons, and the shovels, and the basins. All the
vessels that Hiram made for king Solomon, for the house of the Lord,
were of fine brass.</p>

<p>7:46. In the plains of the Jordan, did the king cast them in a clay
ground, between Socoth and Sartham.</p>

<p>7:47. And Solomon placed all the vessels: but for its exceeding great
multitude the brass could not be weighed.</p>

<p>7:48. And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of the Lord: the
altar of gold, and the table of gold, upon which the loaves of
proposition should be set:</p>

<p>7:49. And the golden candlesticks, five on the right hand, and five on
the left, over against the oracle, of pure gold: and the flowers like
lilies, and the lamps over them of gold: and golden snuffers,</p>

<p>7:50. And pots, and fleshhooks, and bowls, and mortars, and censers, of
most pure gold: and the hinges for the doors of the inner house of the
holy of holies, and for the doors of the house of the temple, were of
gold.</p>

<p>7:51. And Solomon finished all the work that he made in the house of the
Lord, and brought in the things that David, his father, had dedicated,
the silver and the gold, and the vessels, and laid them up in the
treasures of the house of the Lord.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 8</p>

<p>The dedication of the temple: Solomon's prayer and sacrifices.</p>

<p>8:1. Then all the ancients of Israel, with the princes of the tribes,
and the heads of the families of the children of Israel, were assembled
to king Solomon, in Jerusalem: that they might carry the ark of the
covenant of the Lord, out of the city of David, that is, out of Sion.</p>

<p>8:2. And all Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon, on the
festival day, in the month of Ethanim, the same is the seventh month.</p>

<p>8:3. And all the ancients of Israel came, and the priests took up the
ark,</p>

<p>8:4. And carried the ark of the Lord, and the tabernacle of the
covenant, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, that were in the
tabernacle: and the priests and the Levites carried them.</p>

<p>8:5. And king Solomon, and all the multitude of Israel, that were
assembled unto him, went with him before the ark, and they sacrificed
sheep and oxen, that could not be counted or numbered.</p>

<p>8:6. And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into
its place, into the oracle of the temple, into the holy of holies, under
the wings of the cherubims.</p>

<p>8:7. For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the
ark, and covered the ark, and the staves thereof above.</p>

<p>8:8. And whereas the staves stood out, the ends of them were seen
without, in the sanctuary before the oracle, but were not seen farther
out, and there they have been unto this day.</p>

<p>8:9. Now in the ark there was nothing else but the two tables of stone,
which Moses put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the
children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>Nothing else, etc... There was nothing else but the tables of the law
within the ark: but on the outside of the ark, or near the ark were also
the rod of Aaron, and a golden urn with manna, Heb. 9.4.</p>

<p>8:10. And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
sanctuary, that a cloud filled the house of the Lord,</p>

<p>8:11. And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud:
for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord.</p>

<p>8:12. Then Solomon said: The Lord said that he would dwell in a cloud.</p>

<p>8:13. Building, I have built a house for thy dwelling, to be thy most
firm throne for ever.</p>

<p>8:14. And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of
Israel: for all the assembly of Israel stood.</p>

<p>8:15. And Solomon said: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who spoke
with his mouth to David, my father, and with his own hands hath
accomplished it, saying:</p>

<p>8:16. Since the day that I brought my people Israel, out of Egypt, I
chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel, for a house to be built,
that my name might be there: but I chose David to be over my people
Israel.</p>

<p>8:17. And David, my father, would have built a house to the name of the
Lord, the God of Israel:</p>

<p>8:18. And the Lord said to David, my father: Whereas, thou hast thought
in thy heart to build a house to my name, thou hast done well in having
this same thing in thy mind.</p>

<p>8:19. Nevertheless, thou shalt not build me a house, but thy son, that
shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build a house to my name.</p>

<p>8:20. The Lord hath performed his word which he spoke. And I stand in
the room of David, my father, and sit upon the throne of Israel, as the
Lord promised: and have built a house to the name of the Lord, the God
of Israel.</p>

<p>8:21. And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant
of the Lord, which he made with our fathers, when they came out of the
land of Egypt.</p>

<p>8:22. And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord, in the sight of
the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards heaven,</p>

<p>8:23. And said: Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven
above, or on the earth beneath: who keepest covenant and mercy with thy
servants, that have walked before thee with all their heart:</p>

<p>8:24. Who hast kept with thy servant David, my father, what thou hast
promised him: with thy mouth thou didst speak, and with thy hands thou
hast performed, as this day proveth.</p>

<p>8:25. Now, therefore, O Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David,
my father, what thou hast spoken to him, saying: There shall not be
taken away of thee a man in my sight, to sit on the throne of Israel:
yet so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before
me as thou hast walked in my sight.</p>

<p>8:26. And now, Lord God of Israel, let thy words be established, which
thou hast spoken to thy servant David, my father.</p>

<p>8:27. Is it then to be thought that God should indeed dwell upon earth?
for if heaven, and the heavens of heavens, cannot contain thee, how much
less this house which I have built?</p>

<p>8:28. But have regard to the prayer of thy servant, and to his
supplications, O Lord, my God: hear the hymn and the prayer, which thy
servant prayeth before thee this day:</p>

<p>8:29. That thy eyes may be open upon this house, night and day: upon the
house of which thou hast said: &nbsp;My name shall be there: that thou mayst
hearken to the prayer which thy servant prayeth, in this place to thee:</p>

<p>8:30. That thou mayst hearken to the supplication of thy servant, and of
thy people Israel, whatsoever they shall pray for in this place, and
hear them in the place of thy dwelling in heaven; and when thou hearest,
shew them mercy.</p>

<p>8:31. If any man trespass against his neighbour, and have an oath upon
him, wherewith he is bound, and come, because of the oath, before thy
altar, to thy house,</p>

<p>8:32. Then hear thou in heaven: and do and judge thy servants,
condemning the wicked, and bringing his way upon his own head, and
justifying the just, and rewarding him according to his justice.</p>

<p>8:33. If thy people Israel shall fly before their enemies (because they
will sin against thee) and doing penance, and confessing to thy name,
shall come and pray, and make supplications to thee in this house:</p>

<p>8:34. Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people
Israel, and bring them back to the land which thou gavest to their
fathers.</p>

<p>8:35. If heaven shall be shut up, and there shall be no rain, because of
their sins, and they, praying in this place, shall do penance to thy
name, and shall be converted from their sins, by occasion of their
afflictions:</p>

<p>8:36. Then hear thou them in heaven, and forgive the sins of thy
servants, and of thy people Israel: and shew them the good way wherein
they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to
thy people in possession.</p>

<p>8:37. If a famine arise in the land, or a pestilence, or corrupt air, or
blasting, or locust, or mildew; if their enemy afflict them, besieging
the gates, whatsoever plague, whatsoever infirmity,</p>

<p>8:38. Whatsoever curse or imprecation shall happen to any man of thy
people Israel: when a man shall know the wound of his own heart, and
shall spread forth his hands in this house;</p>

<p>8:39. Then hear thou in heaven, in the place of thy dwelling, and
forgive, and do so as to give to every one according to his ways, as
thou shalt see his heart (for thou only knowest the heart of all the
children of men)</p>

<p>8:40. That they may fear thee all the days that they live upon the face
of the land, which thou hast given to our fathers.</p>

<p>8:41. Moreover also the stranger, who is not of thy people Israel, when
he shall come out of a far conntry for thy name's sake, (for they shall
hear every where of thy great name, and thy mighty hand,</p>

<p>8:42. And thy stretched out arm) so when he shall come, and shall pray
in this place,</p>

<p>8:43. Then hear thou in heaven, in the firmament of thy dwelling place,
and do all those things, for which that stranger shall call upon thee:
that all the people of the earth may learn to fear thy name, as do thy
people Israel, and may prove that thy name is called upon on this house,
which I have built.</p>

<p>8:44. If thy people go out to war against their enemies, by what way
soever thou shalt send them, they shall pray to thee towards the way of
the city, which thou hast chosen, and towards the house, which I have
built to thy name:</p>

<p>8:45. And then hear thou in heaven their prayers, and their
supplications, and do judgment for them.</p>

<p>8:46. But if they sin against thee, (for there is no man who sinneth
not) and thou being angry, deliver them up to their enemies, so that
they be led away captives into the land of their enemies, far or near;</p>

<p>8:47. Then if they do penance in their heart, in the place of captivity,
and being converted, make supplication to thee in their captivity,
saying: We have sinned, we have done unjustly, we have committed
wickedness:</p>

<p>8:48. And return to thee with all their heart, and all their soul, in
the land of their enemies, to which they have been led captives: and
pray to thee towards the way of their land, which thou gavest to their
fathers, and of the city which thou hast chosen, and of the temple which
I have built to thy name:</p>

<p>8:49. Then hear thou in heaven, in the firmament of thy throne, their
prayers, and their supplications, and do judgment for them:</p>

<p>8:50. And forgive thy people, that have sinned against thee, and all
their iniquities, by which they have transgressed against thee: and give
them mercy before them that have made them captives, that they may have
compassion on them.</p>

<p>8:51. For they are thy people, and thy inheritance, whom thou hast
brought out of the land of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron.</p>

<p>8:52. That thy eyes may be open to the supplication of thy servant, and
of thy people Israel, to hear them in all things for which they shall
call upon thee.</p>

<p>8:53. For thou hast separated them to thyself for an inheritance, from
amongst all the people of the earth, as thou hast spoken by Moses, thy
servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.</p>

<p>8:54. And it came to pass, when Solomon had made an end of praying all
this prayer and supplication to the Lord, that he rose from before the
altar of the Lord: for he had fixed both knees on the ground, and had
spread his hands towards heaven.</p>

<p>8:55. And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud
voice, saying:</p>

<p>8:56. Blessed be the Lord, who hath given rest to his people Israel,
according to all that he promised: there hath not failed so much as one
word of all the good things that he promised by his servant Moses.</p>

<p>8:57. The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers, and not
leave us, nor cast us off:</p>

<p>8:58. But may he incline our hearts to himself, that we may walk in all
his ways, and keep his commandments, and his ceremonies, and all his
judgments, which he commanded our fathers.</p>

<p>8:59. And let these my words, wherewith I have prayed before the Lord,
be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, that he may do judgment for
his servant, and for his people Israel, day by day:</p>

<p>8:60. That all the people of the earth may know, that the Lord he is
God, and there is no other besides him.</p>

<p>8:61. Let our hearts also be perfect with the Lord our God, that we may
walk in his statutes, and keep his commandments, as at this day.</p>

<p>8:62. And the king, and all Israel with him, offered victims before the
Lord.</p>

<p>8:63. And Solomon slew victims of peace offerings, which he sacrificed
to the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty
thousand sheep so the king, and all the children of Israel, dedicated
the temple of the Lord.</p>

<p>8:64. In that day the king sanctified the middle of the court, that was
before the house of the Lord for there he offered the holocaust, and
sacrifice, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar
that was before the Lord, was too little to receive the holocaust, and
sacrifice, and the fat of the peace offerings.</p>

<p>8:65. And Solomon made at the same time a solemn feast, and all Israel
with him, a great multitude, from the entrance of Emath to the river of
Egypt, before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, that is,
fourteen days.</p>

<p>8:66. And on the eighth day, he sent away the people: and they blessed
the king, and went to their dwellings, rejoicing, and glad in heart, for
all the good things that the Lord had done for David, his servant, and
for Israel, his people.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 9</p>

<p>The Lord appeareth again to Solomon: he buildeth cities: he sendeth a
fleet to Ophir.</p>

<p>9:1. And it came to pass when Solomon had finished the building of the
house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all that he desired and was
pleased to do,</p>

<p>9:2. That the Lord appeared to him the second time, as he had appeared
to him in Gabaon.</p>

<p>9:3. And the Lord said to him: I have heard thy prayer and thy
supplication, which thou hast made before me: I have sanctified this
house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and my
eyes, and my heart, shall be there always.</p>

<p>9:4. And if thou wilt walk before me, as thy father walked, in
simplicity of heart, and in uprightness: and wilt do all that I have
commanded thee, and wilt keep my ordinances, and my judgments,</p>

<p>As thy father walked, in simplicity of heart... That is, in the
sincerity and integrity of a single heart, as opposite to all double
dealing and deceit.</p>

<p>9:5. I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever, as
I promised David, thy father, saying: There shall not fail a man of thy
race upon the throne of Israel.</p>

<p>9:6. But if you and your children, revolting, shall turn away from
following me, and will not keep my commandments, and my ceremonies,
which I have set before you, but will go and worship strange gods, and
adore them:</p>

<p>9:7. I will take away Israel from the face of the land which I have
given them; and the temple which I have sanctified to my name, I will
cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb, and a byword among
all people.</p>

<p>9:8. And this house shall be made an example of: every one that shall
pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss, and say: Why hath the
Lord done thus to this land, and to this house?</p>

<p>9:9. And they shall answer: Because they forsook the Lord their God, who
brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and followed strange
gods, and adored them, and worshipped them: therefore hath the Lord
brought upon them all this evil.</p>

<p>9:10. And when twenty years were ended, after Solomon had built the two
houses; that is, the house of the Lord, and the house of the king,</p>

<p>9:11. (Hiram, the king of Tyre, furnishing Solomon with cedar trees, and
fir trees, and gold, according to all he had need of) then Solomon gave
Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</p>

<p>9:12. And Hiram came out of Tyre, to see the towns which Solomon had
given him, and they pleased him not;</p>

<p>9:13. And he said: Are these the cities which thou hast given me,
brother? And he called them the land of Chabul, unto this day.</p>

<p>Chabul... That is, dirty or displeasing.</p>

<p>9:14. And Hiram sent to king Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of
gold.</p>

<p>9:15. This is the sum of the expenses, which king Solomon offered to
build the house of the Lord, and his own house, and Mello, and the wall
of Jerusalem, and Heser, and Mageddo, and Gazer.</p>

<p>9:16. Pharao, the king of Egypt, came up and took Gazer, and burnt it
with fire: and slew the Chanaanite that dwelt in the city, and gave it
for a dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife.</p>

<p>9:17. So Solomon built Gazer, and Bethhoron the nether,</p>

<p>9:18. And Baalath, and Palmira, in the land of the wilderness.</p>

<p>9:19. And all the towns that belonged to himself, and were not walled,
he fortified; the cities also of the chariots, and the cities of the
horsemen, and whatsoever he had a mind to build in Jerusalem, and in
Libanus, and in all the land of his dominion.</p>

<p>9:20. All the people that were left of the Amorrhites, and Hethites, and
Pherezites, and Hevites, and Jebusites, that are not of the children of
Israel:</p>

<p>9:21. Their children, that were left in the land; to wit, such as the
children of Israel had not been able to destroy, Solomon made tributary
unto this day.</p>

<p>9:22. But of the children of Israel, Solomon made not any to be bondmen,
but they were warriors, and his servants, and his princes, and captains,
and overseers of the chariots and horses.</p>

<p>9:23. And there were five hundred and fifty chief officers set over all
the works of Solomon, and they had people under them, and had charge
over the appointed works.</p>

<p>9:24. And the daughter of Pharao came up out of the city of David to her
house, which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Mello.</p>

<p>9:25. Solomon also offered three times every year holocausts, and
victims of peace offerings, upon the altar which he had built to the
Lord, and he burnt incense before the Lord: and the temple was finished.</p>

<p>9:26. And king Solomon made a fleet in Asiongaber, which is by Ailath,
on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.</p>

<p>9:27. And Hiram sent his servants in the fleet, sailors that had
knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.</p>

<p>9:28. And they came to Ophir; and they brought from thence to king
Solomon four hundred and twenty talents of gold.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 10</p>

<p>The queen of Saba cometh to king Solomon: his riches and glory.</p>

<p>10:1. And the queen of Saba having heard of the fame of Solomon in the
name of the Lord, came to try him with hard questions.</p>

<p>
10:2. And entering into Jerusalem with a great train, and riches, and
camels that carried spices, and an immense quantity of gold, and
precious stones, she came to king Solomon, and spoke to him all that she
had in her heart.</p>

<p>10:3. And Solomon informed her of all the things she proposed to him:
there was not any word the king was ignorant of, and which he could not
answer her.</p>

<p>10:4. And when the queen of Saba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the
house which he had built,</p>

<p>10:5. And the meat of his table, and the apartments of his servants, and
the order of his ministers, and their apparel, and the cupbearers, and
the holocausts, which he offered in the house of the Lord, she had no
longer any spirit in her;</p>

<p>10:6. And she said to the king: The report is true, which I heard in my
own country,</p>

<p>10:7. Concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom. &nbsp;And I did not
believe them that told me, till I came myself, and saw with my own eyes,
and have found that the half hath not been told me: thy wisdom and thy
works exceed the fame which I heard.</p>

<p>10:8. Blessed are thy men, and blessed are thy servants, who stand
before thee always, and hear thy wisdom.</p>

<p>10:9. Blessed be the Lord thy God, whom thou hast pleased, and who hath
set thee upon the throne of Israel, because the Lord hath loved Israel
for ever, and hath appointed thee king, to do judgment and justice.</p>

<p>10:10. And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and
of spices a very great store, and precious stones: there was brought no
more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Saba gave to
king Solomon.</p>

<p>10:11. (The navy also of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought
from Ophir great plenty of thyine trees, and precious stones.</p>

<p>10:12. And the king made of the thyine trees the rails of the house of
the Lord, and of the king's house: and citterns and harps for singers:
there were no such thyine trees as these brought nor seen unto this
day.)</p>

<p>10:13. And king Solomon gave the queen of Saba all that she desired, and
asked of him: besides what he offered her of himself of his royal
bounty. And she returned, and went to her own country, with her
servants.</p>

<p>10:14. And the weight of the gold that was brought to Solomon every
year, was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold:</p>

<p>10:15. Besides that which the men brought him that were over the
tributes, and the merchants, and they that sold by retail, and all the
kings of Arabia, and the governors of the country.</p>

<p>10:16. And Solomon made two hundred shields of the purest gold: he
allowed six hundred sicles of gold for the plates of one shield.</p>

<p>10:17. And three hundred targets of fine gold: three hundred pounds of
gold covered one target: and the king put them in the house of the
forest of Libanus.</p>

<p>10:18. King Solomon also made a great throne of ivory: and overlaid it
with the finest gold.</p>

<p>10:19. It had six steps: and the top of the throne was round behind: and
there were two hands on either side holding the seat: and two lions
stood, one at each hand,</p>

<p>10:20. And twelve little lions stood upon the six steps, on the one side
and on the other: there was no such work made in any kingdom.</p>

<p>10:21. Moreover, all the vessels out of which king Solomon drank, were
of gold: and all the furniture of the house of the forest of Libanus was
of most pure gold: there was no silver, nor was any account made of it
in the days of Solomon:</p>

<p>10:22. For the king's navy, once in three years, went with the navy of
Hiram by sea to Tharsis, and brought from thence gold, and silver, and
elephants' teeth, and apes, and peacocks.</p>

<p>10:23. And king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches
and wisdom.</p>

<p>10:24. And all the earth desired to see Solomon's face, to hear his
wisdom, which God had given in his heart.</p>

<p>10:25. And every one brought him presents, vessels of silver and of
gold, garments, and armour, and spices, and horses, and mules, every
year.</p>

<p>10:26. And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen, and he had a
thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he
bestowed them in fenced cities, and with the king in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>10:27. And he made silver to be as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones: and
cedars to be as common as sycamores which grow in the plains.</p>

<p>10:28. And horses were brought for Solomon out of Egypt, and Coa: for
the king's merchants bought them out of Coa, and brought them at a set
price.</p>

<p>10:29. And a chariot of four horses came out of Egypt, for six hundred
sicles of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. And after this
manner did all the kings of the Hethites, and of Syria, sell horses.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 11</p>

<p>Solomon by means of his wives falleth into idolatry: God raiseth him
adversaries, Adad, Razon, and Jeroboam: Solomon dieth.</p>

<p>11:1. And king Solomon loved many strange women, besides the daughter of
Pharao, and women of Moab, and of Ammon, and of Edom, and of Sidon, and
of the Hethites:</p>

<p>11:2. Of the nations concerning which the Lord said to the children of
Israel: &nbsp;You shall not go in unto them, neither shall any of them come
into yours: for they will most certainly turn away your hearts to follow
their gods. And to these was Solomon joined with a most ardent love.</p>

<p>11:3. And he had seven hundred wives as queens, and three hundred
concubines: and the women turned away his heart.</p>

<p>11:4. And when he was now old, his heart was turned away by women to
follow strange gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his
God, as was the heart of David, his father.</p>

<p>11:5. But Solomon worshipped Astarthe, the goddess of the Sidonians, and
Moloch, the idol of the Ammonites.</p>

<p>11:6. And Solomon did that which was not pleasing before the Lord, and
did not fully follow the Lord, as David, his father.</p>

<p>11:7. Then Solomon built a temple for Chamos, the idol of Moab, on the
hill that is over against Jerusalem, and for Moloch, the idol of the
children of Ammon.</p>

<p>11:8. And he did in this manner for all his wives that were strangers,
who burnt incense, and offered sacrifice to their gods.</p>

<p>11:9. And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his mind was turned
away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice;</p>

<p>11:10. And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not
follow strange gods: but he kept not the things which the Lord commanded
him.</p>

<p>11:11. The Lord therefore said to Solomon: Because thou hast done this,
and hast not kept my covenant, and my precepts, which I have commanded
thee, I will divide and rend thy kingdom, and will give it to thy
servant.</p>

<p>11:12. Nevertheless, in thy days I will not do it, for David thy
father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.</p>

<p>11:13. Neither will I take away the whole kingdom; but I will give one
tribe to thy son, for the sake of David, my servant, and Jerusalem,
which I have chosen.</p>

<p>One tribe... Besides that of Juda, his own native tribe.</p>

<p>11:14. And the Lord raised up an adversary to Solomon, Adad, the
Edomite, of the king's seed, in Edom.</p>

<p>11:15. For when David was in Edom, and Joab, the general of the army,
was gone up to bury them that were slain, and had killed every male in
Edom,</p>

<p>11:16. (For Joab remained there six months with all Israel, till he had
slain every male in Edom,)</p>

<p>11:17. Then Adad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants,
with him, to go into Egypt: and Adad was then a little boy.</p>

<p>11:18. And they arose out of Madian, and came into Pharan, and they took
men with them from Pharan, and went into Egypt, to Pharao, the king of
Egypt: who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and assigned
him land.</p>

<p>11:19. And Adad found great favour before Pharao, insomuch that he gave
him to wife the own sister of his wife, Taphnes, the queen.</p>

<p>11:20. And the sister of Taphnes bore him his son, Genubath; and Taphnes
brought him up in the house of Pharao: and Genubath dwelt with Pharao
among his children.</p>

<p>11:21. And when Adad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,
and that Joab, the general of the army, was dead, he said to Pharao: Let
me depart, that I may go to my own country.</p>

<p>11:22. And Pharao said to him: Why, what is wanting to thee with me,
that thou seekest to go to thy own country? &nbsp;But he answered: Nothing;
yet I beseech thee to let me go.</p>

<p>11:23. God also raised up against him an adversary, Razon, the son of
Eliada, who had fled from his master, Adarezer, the king of Soba.</p>

<p>11:24. And he gathered men against him, and he became a captain of
robbers, when David slew them of Soba: and they went to Damascus, and
dwelt there, and they made him king in Damascus.</p>

<p>11:25. And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon: and
this is the evil of Adad, and his hatred against Israel; and he reigned
in Syria.</p>

<p>11:26. Jeroboam also, the son of Nabat, an Ephrathite, of Sareda, a
servant of Solomon, whose mother was named Sarua, a widow woman, lifted
up his hand against the king.</p>

<p>11:27. And this is the cause of his rebellion against him; for Solomon
built Mello, and filled up the breach of the city of David, his father.</p>

<p>11:28. And Jeroboam was a valiant and mighty man: and Solomon seeing him
a young man ingenious and industrious, made him chief over the tributes
of all the house of Joseph.</p>

<p>11:29. So it came to pass at that time, that Jeroboam went out of
Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahias, the Silonite, clad with a new garment,
found him in the way: and they two were alone in the field.</p>

<p>11:30. And Ahias taking his new garment, wherewith he was clad, divided
it into twelve parts:</p>

<p>11:31. And he said to Jeroboam: Take to thee ten pieces: for thus saith
the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the
hand of Solomon, and will give thee ten tribes.</p>

<p>11:32. But one tribe shall remain to him for the sake of my servant,
David, and Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes
of Israel:</p>

<p>11:33. Because he hath forsaken me, and hath adored Astarthe, the
goddess of the Sidonians, and Chamos, the god of Moab, and Moloch, the
god of the children of Ammon: and hath not walked in my ways, to do
justice before me, and to keep my precepts, and judgments, as did David,
his father.</p>

<p>11:34. Yet I will not take away all the kingdom out of his hand, but I
will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant's
sake, whom I chose, who kept my commandments, and my precepts.</p>

<p>11:35. But I will take away the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will
give thee ten tribes:</p>

<p>11:36. And to his son I will give one tribe, that there may remain a
lamp for my servant, David, before me always in Jerusalem, the city
which I have chosen, that my name might be there.</p>

<p>11:37. And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul
desireth, and thou shalt be king over Israel.</p>

<p>11:38. If then thou wilt hearken to all that I shall command thee, and
wilt walk in my ways, and do what is right before me, keeping my
commandments and my precepts, as David, my servant, did: I will be with
thee, and will build thee up a faithful house, as I built a house for
David, and I will deliver Israel to thee:</p>

<p>11:39. And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but yet not for
ever.</p>

<p>11:40. Solomon, therefore, sought to kill Jeroboam: but he arose, and
fled into Egypt, to Sesac, the king of Egypt, and was in Egypt till the
death of Solomon.</p>

<p>11:41. And the rest of the words of Solomon, and all that he did and his
wisdom: behold they are all written in the book of the words of the days
of Solomon.</p>

<p>The book of the words, etc... This book is lost, with divers others
mentioned in holy writ.</p>

<p>11:42. And the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem, over all Israel,
were forty years.</p>

<p>11:43. And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
David, his father; and Roboam, his son, reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>Solomon slept, etc... That is, died. He was then about fifty-eight years
of age, having reigned forty years.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 12</p>

<p>Roboam, following the counsel of young men alienateth from him the minds
of the people. They make Jeroboam king over ten tribes: he setteth up
idolatry.</p>

<p>12:1. And Roboam went to Sichem: for thither were all Israel come
together to make him king.</p>

<p>12:2. But Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who was yet in Egypt, a fugitive
from the face of king Solomon, hearing of his death, returned out of
Egypt.</p>

<p>12:3. And they sent and called him: and Jeroboam came, and all the
multitude of Israel, and they spoke to Roboam, saying:</p>

<p>12:4. Thy father laid a grievous yoke upon us: now, therefore, do thou
take off a little of the grievous service of thy father, and of his most
heavy yoke, which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.</p>

<p>12:5. And he said to them: Go till the third day, and come to me again.
And when the people was gone,</p>

<p>12:6. King Roboam took counsel with the old men, that stood before
Solomon, his father, while he yet lived, and he said: &nbsp;What counsel do
you give me, that I may answer this people?</p>

<p>12:7. They said to him: If thou wilt yield to this people to day, and
condescend to them, and grant their petition, and wilt speak gentle
words to them, they will be thy servants always.</p>

<p>12:8. But he left the counsel of the old men, which they had given him,
and consulted with the young men that had been brought up with him, and
stood before him.</p>

<p>12:9. And he said to them: What counsel do you give me, that I may
answer this people, who have said to me: Make the yoke, which thy father
put upon us, lighter?</p>

<p>12:10. And the young men that had been brought up with him, said: Thus
shalt thou speak to this people, who have spoken to thee, saying: Thy
father made our yoke heavy, do thou ease us. &nbsp;Thou shalt say to them: My
little finger is thicker than the back of my father.</p>

<p>12:11. And now my father put a heavy yoke upon you, but I will add to
your yoke: my father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with
scorpions.</p>

<p>12:12. So Jeroboam, and all the people, came to Roboam the third day, as
the king had appointed, saying: Come to me again the third day.</p>

<p>12:13. And the king answered the people roughly, leaving the counsel of
the old men, which they had given him,</p>

<p>12:14. And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men,
saying: My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: My
father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions.</p>

<p>12:15. And the king condescended not to the people: for the Lord was
turned away from him, to make good his word, which he had spoken in the
hand of Ahias, the Silonite, to Jeroboam, the son of Nabat.</p>

<p>12:16. Then the people, seeing that the king would not hearken to them,
answered him, saying: What portion have we in David? or what inheritance
in the son of Isai? Go home to thy dwellings, O Israel: now, David, look
to thy own house. So Israel departed to their dwellings.</p>

<p>12:17. But as for all the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of
Juda, Roboam reigned over them.</p>

<p>12:18. Then king Roboam sent Aduram, who was over the tribute: and all
Israel stoned him, and he died. &nbsp;Wherefore king Roboam made haste to get
him up into his chariot, and he fled to Jerusalem:</p>

<p>12:19. And Israel revolted from the house of David, unto this day.</p>

<p>12:20. And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come
again, that they gathered an assembly, and sent and called him, and made
him king over all Israel, and there was none that followed the house of
David but the tribe of Juda only.</p>

<p>Juda only... Benjamin was a small tribe, and so intermixed with the
tribe of Juda, (the very city of Jerusalem being partly in Juda, partly
in Benjamin,) that they are here counted but as one tribe.</p>

<p>12:21. And Roboam came to Jerusalem, and gathered together all the house
of Juda, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred fourscore thousand chosen
men for war, to fight against the house of Israel, and to bring the
kingdom again under Roboam, the son of Solomon.</p>

<p>12:22. But the word of the Lord came to Semeias, the man of God, saying:</p>

<p>12:23. Speak to Roboam, the son of Solomon, the king of Juda, and to all
the house of Juda, and Benjamin, and the rest of the people, saying:</p>

<p>12:24. Thus saith the Lord: You shall not go up, nor fight against your
brethren, the children of Israel: let every man return to his house, for
this thing is from me. They hearkened to the word of the Lord, and
returned from their journey, as the Lord had commanded them.</p>

<p>12:25. And Jeroboam built Sichem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt there, and
going out from thence, he built Phanuel.</p>

<p>12:26. And Jeroboam said in his heart: Now shall the kingdom return to
the house of David,</p>

<p>12:27. If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the Lord
at Jerusalem: and the heart of this people will turn to their lord
Roboam, the king of Juda, and they will kill me, and return to him.</p>

<p>12:28. &nbsp;And finding out a device, he made two golden calves, and said to
them: Go ye up no more to Jerusalem: Behold thy gods, O Israel, who
brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>Golden calves... It is likely, by making his gods in this form, he
mimicked the Egyptians, among whom he had sojourned, who worshipped
their Apis and their Osiris under the form of a bullock.</p>

<p>12:29. And he set the one in Bethel, and the other in Dan:</p>

<p>Bethel and Dan... Bethel was a city of the tribe of Ephraim in the
southern part of the dominions of Jeroboam, about six leagues from
Jerusalem; Dan was in the extremity of his dominions to the north in the
confines of Syria.</p>

<p>12:30. And this thing became an occasion of sin: for the people went to
adore the calf as far as Dan.</p>

<p>12:31. And he made temples in the high places, and priests of the lowest
of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.</p>

<p>12:32. And he appointed a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth
day of the month, after the manner of the feast that was celebrated in
Juda. And going up to the altar, he did in like manner in Bethel, to
sacrifice to the calves, which he had made: and he placed in Bethel
priests of the high places, which he had made.</p>

<p>12:33. And he went up to the altar, which he had built in Bethel, on the
fifteenth day of the eighth month, which he had devised of his own
heart: and he ordained a feast to the children of Israel, and went up on
the altar to burn incense.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 13</p>

<p>A prophet sent from Juda to Bethel foretelleth the birth of Josias, and
the destruction of Jeroboam's altar. Jeroboam's hand offering violence
to the prophet withereth, but is restored by the prophet's prayer: the
same prophet is deceived by another prophet, and slain by a lion.</p>

<p>13:1. And behold there came a man of God out of Juda, by the word of the
Lord, to Bethel, when Jeroboam was standing upon the altar, and burning
incense.</p>

<p>13:2. And he cried out against the altar in the word of the Lord, and
said: O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord: Behold a child shall be born
to the house of David, Josias by name, and he shall immolate upon thee
the priests of the high places, who now burn incense upon thee, and he
shall burn men's bones upon thee.</p>

<p>13:3. And he gave a sign the same day, saying: This shall be the sign,
that the Lord hath spoken: Behold the altar shall be rent, and the ashes
that are upon it, shall be poured out.</p>

<p>13:4. And when the king had heard the word of the man of God, which he
had cried out against the altar in Bethel, he stretched forth his hand
from the altar, saying: Lay hold on him. And his hand which he stretched
forth against him, withered: and he was not able to draw it back again
to him.</p>

<p>13:5. The altar also was rent, and the ashes were poured out from the
altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given before in
the word of the Lord.</p>

<p>13:6. And the king said to the man of God: Entreat the face of the Lord
thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me. And the
man of God besought the face of the Lord, and the king's hand was
restored to him, and it became as it was before.</p>

<p>13:7. And the king said to the man of God: Come home with me to dine,
and I will make thee presents.</p>

<p>13:8. And the man of God answered the king: If thou wouldst give me half
thy house, I will not go with thee, nor eat bread, nor drink water in
this place:</p>

<p>13:9. For so it was enjoined me by the word of the Lord commanding me:
Thou shalt not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way
that thou camest.</p>

<p>13:10. So he departed by another way, and returned not by the way that
he came into Bethel.</p>

<p>13:11. Now a certain old prophet dwelt in Bethel, and his sons came to
him, and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in
Bethel: and they told their father the words which he had spoken to the
king.</p>

<p>13:12. And their father said to them: What way went he? His sons shewed
him the way by which the man of God went, who came out of Juda.</p>

<p>13:13. And he said to his sons: Saddle me the ass. And when they had
saddled it, he got up,</p>

<p>13:14. And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under a
turpentine tree: and he said to him: Art thou the man of God who camest
from Juda? He answered: I am.</p>

<p>13:15. And he said to him: Come home with me to eat bread.</p>

<p>13:16. But he said: I must not return, nor go with thee, neither will I
eat bread, or drink water in this place:</p>

<p>13:17. Because the Lord spoke to me, in the word of the Lord, saying:
Thou shalt not eat bread, and thou shalt not drink water there, nor
return by the way thou wentest.</p>

<p>13:18. He said to him: I also am a prophet like unto thee: and an angel
spoke to me, in the word of the Lord, saying: Bring him back with thee
into thy house, that he may eat bread, and drink water. He deceived him,</p>

<p>An angel spoke to me, etc... This old man of Bethel was indeed a
prophet, but he sinned in thus deceiving the man of God; the more
because he pretended a revelation for what he did.</p>

<p>13:19. And brought him back with him: so he ate bread, and drank water
in his house.</p>

<p>13:20. And as they sat at table, the word of the Lord came to the
prophet that brought him back:</p>

<p>13:21. And he cried out to the man of God who came out of Juda, saying:
Thus saith the Lord: Because thou hast not been obedient to the Lord,
and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee,</p>

<p>13:22. And hast returned, and eaten bread, and drunk water in the place
wherein he commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat bread, nor drink
water, thy dead body shall not be brought into the sepulchre of thy
fathers.</p>

<p>13:23. And when he had eaten and drunk, he saddled his ass for the
prophet, whom he had brought back.</p>

<p>13:24. And when he was gone, a lion found him in the way, and killed
him, and his body was cast in the way: and the ass stood by him, and the
lion stood by the dead body.</p>

<p>Killed him... Thus the Lord often punishes his servants here, that he
may spare them hereafter. For the generality of divines are of opinion,
that the sin of this prophet, considered with all its circumstances, was
not mortal.</p>

<p>13:25. And behold, men passing by, saw the dead body cast in the way,
and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the
city, wherein that old prophet dwelt.</p>

<p>13:26. And when that prophet, who had brought him back out of the way,
heard of it, he said: It is the man of God, that was disobedient to the
mouth of the Lord, and the Lord hath delivered him to the lion, and he
hath torn him, and killed him, according to the word of the Lord, which
he spoke to him.</p>

<p>13:27. And he said to his sons: Saddle me an ass. And when they had
saddled it,</p>

<p>13:28. And he was gone, he found the dead body cast in the way, and the
ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten of the
dead body, nor hurt the ass.</p>

<p>13:29. And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it
upon the ass, and going back brought it into the city of the old
prophet, to mourn for him.</p>

<p>13:30. And he laid his dead body in his own sepulchre: and they mourned
over him, saying: &nbsp;Alas! alas, my brother.</p>

<p>13:31. And when they had mourned over him, he said to his sons: When I
am dead, bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried: lay
my bones beside his bones.</p>

<p>13:32. For assuredly the word shall come to pass which he hath foretold
in the word of the Lord, against the altar that is in Bethel: and
against all the temples of the high places, that are in the cities of
Samaria.</p>

<p>13:33. After these words, Jeroboam came not back from his wicked way:
but on the contrary, he made of the meanest of the people priests of the
high places: whosoever would, he filled his hand, and he was made a
priest of the high places.</p>

<p>13:34. And for this cause did the house of Jeroboam sin, and was cut
off, and destroyed from the face of the earth.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 14</p>

<p>Ahias prophesieth the destruction of the family of Jeroboam. &nbsp;He dieth,
and is succeeded by his son Nadab. The king of Egypt taketh and
pillageth Jerusalem. Roboam dieth and his son Abiam succeedeth.</p>

<p>14:1. At that time Abia, the son of Jeroboam, fell sick.</p>

<p>14:2. And Jeroboam said to his wife: Arise, and change thy dress, that
thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Silo, where
Ahias, the prophet is, who told me that I should reign over this people.</p>

<p>14:3. Take also with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a pot of honey,
and go to him: for he will tell thee what will become of this child.</p>

<p>14:4. Jeroboam's wife did as he told her: and rising up, went to Silo,
and came to the house of Ahias; but he could not see, for his eyes were
dim by reason of his age.</p>

<p>14:5. And the Lord said to Ahias: Behold the wife of Jeroboam cometh in,
to consult thee concerning her son, that is sick: thus and thus shalt
thou speak to her. So when she was coming in, and made as if she were
another woman,</p>

<p>14:6. Ahias heard the sound of her feet, coming in at the door, and
said: Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam: why dost thou feign thyself to be
another? But I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.</p>

<p>14:7. Go, and tell Jeroboam: Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: For
as much as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince
over my people Israel;</p>

<p>14:8. And rent the kingdom away from thc house of David, and gave it to
thee, and thou hast not been as my servant, David, who kept my
commandments, and followed me with all his heart, doing that which was
well pleasing in my sight:</p>

<p>14:9. But hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast made
thee strange gods, and molten gods, to provoke me to anger, and hast
cast me behind thy back:</p>

<p>14:10. Therefore, behold I will bring evils upon the house of Jeroboam,
and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and
him that is shut up, and the last in Israel: and I will sweep away the
remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as dung is swept away till all be
clean.</p>

<p>14:11. Them that shall die of Jeroboam in the city, the dogs shall eat:
and them that shall die in the field, the birds of the air shall devour:
for the Lord hath spoken it.</p>

<p>14:12. Arise thou, therefore, and go to thy house: and when thy feet
shall be entering into the city, the child shall die,</p>

<p>14:13. And all Israel shall mourn for him, and shall bury him: for he
only of Jeroboam shall be laid in a sepulchre, because in his regard
there is found a good word from the Lord, the God of Israel, in the
house of Jeroboam.</p>

<p>14:14. And the Lord hath appointed himself a king over Israel, who shall
cut off the house of Jeroboam in this day, and in this time:</p>

<p>14:15. And the Lord God shall strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the
water: and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave
to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river: because they
have made to themselves groves, to provoke the Lord.</p>

<p>14:16. And the Lord shall give up Israel for the sins of Jeroboam, who
hath sinned, and made Israel to sin.</p>

<p>14:17. And the wife of Jeroboam arose, and departed, and came to Thersa:
and when she was coming in to the threshold of the house, the child
died,</p>

<p>14:18. And they buried him. And all Israel mourned for him, according to
the word of the Lord, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahias,
the prophet.</p>

<p>14:19. And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he
reigned, behold they are written in the book of the words of the days of
the kings of Israel.</p>

<p>The book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel... This book,
which is often mentioned in the Book of Kings, is long since lost. For
as to the books of Paralipomenon, or Chronicles, (which the Hebrews call
the words of the days,) they were certainly written after the Book of
Kings, since they frequently refer to them.</p>

<p>14:20. And the days that Jeroboam reigned, were two and twenty years:
and he slept with his fathers: and Nadab, his son, reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>14:21. And Roboam, the son of Solomon, reigned in Juda: Roboam was one
and forty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned seventeen
years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord chose out of all the tribes
of Israel to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naama, an
Ammonitess.</p>

<p>14:22. And Juda did evil in the sight of the Lord, and provoked him
above all that their fathers had done, in their sins which they
committed.</p>

<p>14:23. For they also built them altars, and statues, and groves, upon
every high hill, and under every green tree:</p>

<p>14:24. There were also the effeminate in the land, and they did
according to all the abominations of the people, whom the Lord had
destroyed before the face of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>The effeminate... Catamites, or men addicted to unnatural lust.</p>

<p>14:25. And in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Sesac, king of
Egypt, came up against Jerusalem.</p>

<p>14:26. And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the
king's treasures, and carried all off: as also the shields of gold which
Solomon had made:</p>

<p>14:27. And Roboam made shields of brass instead of them, and delivered
them into the hand of the captains of the shieldbearers, and of them
that kept watch before the gate of the king's house.</p>

<p>14:28. And when the king went into the house of the Lord, they whose
office it was to go before him, carried them: and afterwards they
brought them back to the armoury of the shieldbearers.</p>

<p>14:29. Now the rest of the acts of Roboam, and all that he did, behold
they are written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of
Juda.</p>

<p>14:30. And there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam always.</p>

<p>14:31. And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with them, in
the city of David: &nbsp;and his mother's name was Naama, an Ammonitess: and
Abiam, his son, reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 15</p>

<p>The acts of Abiam and of Asa kings of Juda. And of Nadab and Baasa kings
of Israel.</p>

<p>15:1. Now in the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, the son of
Nabat, Abiam reigned over Juda.</p>

<p>15:2. He reigned three years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was
Maacha, the daughter of Abessalom.</p>

<p>Maacha, etc... She is called elsewhere Michaia, daughter of Uriel; but
it was common in those days for the same person to have two names.</p>

<p>15:3. And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
before him: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was
the heart of David, his father.</p>

<p>15:4. But for David's sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in
Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:</p>

<p>15:5. Because David had done that which was right in the eyes of the
Lord, and had not turned aside from any thing that he commanded him, all
the days of his life, except the matter of Urias, the Hethite.</p>

<p>15:6. But there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam all the time of his
life.</p>

<p>15:7. And the rest of the words of Abiam, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?
And there was war between Abiam and Jeroboam.</p>

<p>15:8. And Abiam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city
of David: and Asa, his son, reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>15:9. So in the twentieth year of Jeroboam, king of Israel, reigned Asa,
king of Juda,</p>

<p>15:10. And he reigned one and forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's
name was Maacha, the daughter of Abessalom.</p>

<p>His mother, etc... That is, his grandmother; unless we suppose, which is
not improbable, that the Maacha here named is different from the Maacha
mentioned, ver. 2.</p>

<p>15:11. And Asa did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, as did
David, his father:</p>

<p>15:12. And he took away the effeminate out of the land, and removed all
the filth of the idols, which his fathers had made.</p>

<p>15:13. Moreover, he also removed his mother, Maacha, from being the
princess in the sacrifices of Priapus, and in the grove which she had
consecrated to him: and he destroyed her den, and broke in pieces the
filthy idol, and burnt it by the torrent Cedron:</p>

<p>15:14. But the high places he did not take away. Nevertheless, the heart
of Asa was perfect with the Lord all his days:</p>

<p>The high places... There were excelsa or high places of two different
kinds. Some were set up, and dedicated to the worship of idols, or
strange gods; and these Asa removed, 2 Par. 14.2; others were only
altars of the true God, but were erected contrary to the law, which
allowed of no sacrifices but in the temple; and these were not removed
by Asa.-Ibid. Perfect with the Lord... Asa had his faults; but never
forsook the worship of the Lord.</p>

<p>15:15. And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and
he had vowed, into the house of the Lord, silver and gold, and vessels.</p>

<p>15:16. And there was war between Asa, and Baasa, king of Israel, all
their days.</p>

<p>15:17. And Baasa, king of Israel, went up against Juda, and built Rama,
that no man might go out or come in of the side of Asa, king of Juda.</p>

<p>15:18. Then Asa took all the silver and gold that remained in the
treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's
house, and delivered it into the hands of his servants: and sent them to
Benadad, son of Tabremon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt in
Damascus, saying:</p>

<p>15:19. There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and
thy father: therefore I have sent thee presents of silver and gold: and
I desire thee to come, and break thy league with Baasa, king of Israel,
that he may depart from me.</p>

<p>15:20. Benadad, hearkening to king Asa, sent the captains of his army
against the cities of Israel, and they smote Ahion, and Dan, and
Abeldomum Maacha, and all Cenneroth; that is all the land of Nephthali.</p>

<p>15:21. And when Baasa had heard this, he left off building Rama, and
returned into Thersa.</p>

<p>15:22. But king Asa sent word into all Juda, saying: Let no man be
excused: and they took away the stones from Rama, and the timber
thereof, wherewith Baasa had been building, and with them king Asa built
Gabaa of Benjamin, and Maspha.</p>

<p>15:23. But the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his strength, and
all that he did, and the cities that he built, are they not written in
the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? But in the time
of his old age he was diseased in his feet.</p>

<p>15:24. And he slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the
city of David, his father. And Josaphat, his son, reigned in his place.</p>

<p>15:25. But Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, reigned over Israel the second
year of Asa, king of Juda: and he reigned over Israel two years.</p>

<p>15:26. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways
of his father, and in his sins, wherewith he made Israel to sin.</p>

<p>15:27. And Baasa, the son of Ahias, of the house of Issachar, conspired
against him, and slew him in Gebbethon, which is a city of the
Philistines: for Nadab and all Israel besieged Gebbethon.</p>

<p>15:28. So Baasa slew him in the third year of Asa, king of Juda, and
reigned in his place.</p>

<p>15:29. And when he was king, he cut off all the house of Jeroboam: he
left not so much as one soul of his seed, till he had utterly destroyed
him, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken in the hand
of Ahias, the Silonite:</p>

<p>15:30. Because of the sin of Jeroboam, which he had sinned, and
wherewith he had made Israel to sin, and for the offence wherewith he
provoked the Lord, the God of Israel.</p>

<p>15:31. But the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</p>

<p>15:32. And there was war between Asa and Baasa, the king of Israel, all
their days.</p>

<p>15:33. In the third year of Asa, king of Juda, Baasa, the son of Ahias,
reigned over all Israel, in Thersa, four and twenty years.</p>

<p>15:34. And he did evil before the Lord, and walked in the ways of
Jeroboam, and in his sins, wherewith he made Israel to sin.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 16</p>

<p>Jehu prophesieth against Baasa: his son Ela is slain and all his family
destroyed by Zambri. Of the reign of Amri father of Achab.</p>

<p>16:1. Then the word of the Lord came to Jehu, the son of Hanani, against
Baasa, saying:</p>

<p>16:2. For as much as I have exalted thee out of the dust and made thee
prince over my people Israel, and thou hast walked in the way of
Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger
with their sins:</p>

<p>16:3. Behold I will cut down the posterity of Baasa, and the posterity
of his house, and I will make thy house as the house of Jeroboam, the
son of Nabat.</p>

<p>16:4. Him that dieth of Baasa, in the city, the dogs shall eat: and him
that dieth of his in the country, the fowls of the air shall devour.</p>

<p>16:5. &nbsp;But the rest of the acts of Baasa, and all that he did, and his
battles, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of
the kings of Israel?</p>

<p>16:6. So Baasa slept with his fathers, and was buried in Thersa: and
Ela, his son, reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>16:7. And when the word of the Lord came in the hand of Jehu, the son of
Hanani, the prophet, against Baasa, and against his house, and against
all the evil that he had done before the Lord, to provoke him to anger
by the works of his hands, to become as the house of Jeroboam: for this
cause he slew him; that is to say, Jehu, the son of Hanani, the prophet.</p>

<p>16:8. In the six and twentieth year of Asa, king of Juda, Ela, the son
of Baasa, reigned over Israel, in Thersa, two years.</p>

<p>16:9. And his servant Zambri, who was captain of half the horsemen,
rebelled against him: now Ela was drinking in Thersa, and drunk in the
house of Arsa, the governor of Thersa.</p>

<p>16:10. And Zambri rushing in, struck him, and slew him, in the seven and
twentieth year of Asa, king of Juda and he reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>16:11. And when he was king, and sat upon his throne, he slew all the
house of Baasa, and he left not one thereof to piss against a wall and
all his kinsfolks and friends.</p>

<p>16:12. And Zambri destroyed all the house of Baasa, according to the
word of the Lord, that he had spoken to Baasa, in the hand of Jehu, the
prophet,</p>

<p>16:13. For all the sins of Baasa, and the sins of Ela, his son, who
sinned, and made Israel to sin, provoking the Lord, the God of Israel,
with their vanities.</p>

<p>16:14. But the rest of the acts of Ela, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</p>

<p>16:15. In the seven and twentieth year of Asa, king of Juda, Zambri
reigned seven days in Thersa: now the army was besieging Gebbethon, a
city of the Philistines.</p>

<p>16:16. And when they heard that Zambri had rebelled, and slain the king,
all Israel made Amri their king, who was general over Israel in the camp
that day.</p>

<p>16:17. And Amri went up, and all Israel with him, from Gebbethon, and
they besieged Thersa.</p>

<p>16:18. And Zambri, seeing that the city was about to be taken, went into
the palace, and burnt himself with the king's house: and he died</p>

<p>16:19. In his sins, which he had sinned, doing evil before the Lord, and
walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin, wherewith he made Israel
to sin.</p>

<p>16:20. But the rest of the acts of Zambri, and of his conspiracy and
tyranny, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of
the kings of Israel?</p>

<p>16:21. Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: one half
of the people followed Thebni, the son of Gineth, to make him king: and
one half followed Amri.</p>

<p>16:22. But the people that were with Amri, prevailed over the people
that followed Thebni, the son of Gineth: and Thebni died, and Amri
reigned.</p>

<p>16:23. In the one and thirtieth year of Asa, king of Juda, Amri reigned
over Israel twelve years: in Thersa he reigned six years.</p>

<p>In the one and thirtieth year, etc... Amri began to reign in the seven
and twentieth year of Asa; but had not quiet possession of the kingdom
till the death of his competitor Thebni, which was in the one and
thirtieth year of Asa's reign.</p>

<p>16:24. And he bought the hill of Samaria of Semer, for two talents of
silver: and he built upon it, and he called the city which he built
Samaria, after the name of Semer, the owner of the hill.</p>

<p>16:25. And Amri did evil in the sight of the Lord, and acted wickedly
above all that were before him.</p>

<p>16:26. And he walked in all the way of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, and
in his sins, wherewith he made Israel to sin: to provoke the Lord, the
God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.</p>

<p>With their vanities... That is, their idols their golden calves, vain,
false, deceitful things.</p>

<p>16:27. Now the rest of the acts of Amri, and the battles he fought, are
they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of
Israel?</p>

<p>16:28. And Amri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria, and
Achab, his son, reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>16:29. Now Achab, the son of Amri, reigned over Israel in the eight and
thirtieth year of Asa, king of Juda. And Achab, the son of Amri, reigned
over Israel in Samaria two and twenty years.</p>

<p>16:30. And Achab, the son of Amri, did evil in the sight of the Lord
above all that were before him.</p>

<p>16:31. Nor was it enough for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam, the
son of Nabat: but he also took to wife Jezabel, daughter of Ethbaal,
king of the Sidonians. And he went, and served Baal, and adored him.</p>

<p>16:32. And he set up an altar for Baal, in the temple of Baal, which he
had built in Samaria;</p>

<p>16:33. And he planted a grove: and Achab did more to provoke the Lord,
the God of Israel, than all the kings of Israel that were before him.</p>

<p>16:34. In his days Hiel, of Bethel, built Jericho: in Abiram, his
firstborn, he laid its foundations: and in his youngest son, Segub, he
set up the gates thereof: according to the word of the Lord, which he
spoke in the hand of Josue, the son of Nun.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 17</p>

<p>Elias shutteth up the heaven from raining. He is fed by ravens, and
afterwards by a widow of Sarephta. He raiseth the window's son to life.</p>

<p>17:1. And Elias the Thesbite, of the inhabitants of Galaad, said to
Achab: &nbsp;As the Lord liveth, the God of Israel, in whose sight I stand,
there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to the words
of my mouth.</p>

<p>17:2. And the word of the Lord came to him, saying:</p>

<p>17:3. Get thee hence, and go towards the east, and hide thyself by the
torrent of Carith, which is over against the Jordan;</p>

<p>17:4. And there thou shalt drink of the torrent: and I have commanded
the ravens to feed thee there.</p>

<p>17:5. So he went, and did according to the word of the Lord: and going,
he dwelt by the torrent Carith, which is over against the Jordan.</p>

<p>17:6. And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and
bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the torrent.</p>

<p>17:7. But after some time the torrent was dried up: for it had not
rained upon the earth.</p>

<p>17:8. Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying:</p>

<p>17:9. Arise, and go to Sarephta of the Sidonians, and dwell there: for I
have commanded a widow woman there to feed thee.</p>

<p>Sarephta of the Sidonians... That is, a city of the Sidonians.</p>

<p>17:10. He arose, and went to Sarephta. And when he was come to the gate
of the city, he saw the widow woman gathering sticks, and he called her,
and said to her: Give me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.</p>

<p>17:11. And when she was going to fetch it, he called after her, saying:
Bring me also, I beseech thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.</p>

<p>17:12. And she answered: As the Lord thy God liveth, I have no bread,
but only a handful of meal in a pot, and a little oil in a cruise:
behold I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it, for me
and my son, that we may eat it and die.</p>

<p>17:13. And Elias said to her: Fear not; but go, and do as thou hast said
but first make for me of the same meal a little hearth cake, and bring
it to me, and after make for thyself and thy son.</p>

<p>17:14. For thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: The pot of meal shall
not waste, nor the cruise of oil be diminished, until the day wherein
the Lord will give rain upon the face of the earth.</p>

<p>17:15. She went, and did according to the word of Elias: and he ate, and
she, and her house: and from that day</p>

<p>17:16. The pot of meal wasted not, and the cruise of oil was not
diminished according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke in the hand
of Elias.</p>

<p>17:17. And it came to pass after this, that the son of the woman, the
mistress of the house, fell sick, and the sickness was very grievous, so
that there was no breath left in him.</p>

<p>17:18. And she said to Elias: What have I to do with thee, thou man of
God? art thou come to me, that my iniquities should be remembered, and
that thou shouldst kill my son?</p>

<p>17:11. And Elias said to her: Give me thy son. And he took him out of
her bosom, and carried him into the upper chamber where he abode, and
laid him upon his own bed.</p>

<p>17:20. And he cried to the Lord, and said: O Lord, my God, hast thou
afflicted also the widow, with whom I am after a sort maintained, so as
to kill her son?</p>

<p>17:21. And he stretched, and measured himself upon the child three
times, and cried to the Lord, and said: O Lord, my God, let the soul of
this child, I beseech thee, return into his body.</p>

<p>17:22. And the Lord heard the voice of Elias: and the soul of the child
returned into him, and he revived.</p>

<p>17:23. And Elias took the child, and brought him down from the upper
chamber to the house below, and delivered him to his mother, and said to
her: Behold thy son liveth.</p>

<p>17:24. And the woman said to Elias: Now by this I know that thou art a
man of God, and the word of the Lord in thy mouth is true.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 18</p>

<p>Elias cometh before Achab. He convinceth the false prophets by bringing
fire from heaven: he obtaineth rain by his prayer.</p>

<p>18:1. After many days, the word of the Lord came to Elias, in the third
year, saying: Go, and shew thyself to Achab, that I may give rain upon
the face of the earth.</p>

<p>18:2. And Elias went to shew himself to Achab, and there was a grievous
famine in Samaria.</p>

<p>18:3. And Achab called Abdias the governor of his house: now Abdias
feared the Lord very much.</p>

<p>18:4. For when Jezabel killed the prophets of the Lord, he took a
hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty and fifty in caves, and fed them
with bread and water.</p>

<p>18:5. And Achab said to Abdias: Go into the land unto all fountains of
waters, and into all valleys, to see if we can find grass, and save the
horses and mules, that the beasts may not utterly perish.</p>

<p>18:6. And they divided the countries between them, that they might go
round about them: Achab went one way, and Abdias another way by himself.</p>

<p>18:7. And as Abdias was in the way, Elias met him: &nbsp;and he knew him, and
fell on his face, and said: Art thou my lord Elias?</p>

<p>18:8. And he answered: I am. &nbsp;Go, and tell thy master: Elias is here.</p>

<p>18:9. And he said: What have I sinned, that thou wouldst deliver me, thy
servant, into the hand of Achab, that he should kill me?</p>

<p>18:10. As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom,
whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when all answered: He is
not here: he took an oath of every kingdom and nation, because thou wast
not found.</p>

<p>18:11. And now thou sayest to me: &nbsp;Go and tell thy master: Elias is
here.</p>

<p>18:12. And when I am gone from thee, the Spirit of the Lord will carry
thee into a place that I know not: and I shall go in and tell Achab; and
he, not finding thee, will kill me: but thy servant feareth the Lord
from his infancy.</p>

<p>18:13. Hath it not been told thee, my lord, what I did when Jezabel
killed the prophets of the Lord; how I hid a hundred men of the prophets
of the Lord, by fifty and fifty in caves, and fed them with bread and
water?</p>

<p>18:14. And now thou sayest: Go and tell thy master: Elias is here: that
he may kill me.</p>

<p>18:15. And Elias said: As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whose face I
stand, this day I will shew myself unto him.</p>

<p>18:16. Abdias therefore went to meet Achab, and told him: and Achab came
to meet Elias.</p>

<p>18:17. And when he had seen him, he said: Art thou he that troublest
Israel?</p>

<p>18:18. And he said: I have not troubled Israel, but thou and thy
father's house, who have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and have
followed Baalim.</p>

<p>18:19. Nevertheless send now, and gather unto me all Israel, unto Mount
Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the
prophets of the groves four hundred, who eat at Jezabel's table.</p>

<p>18:20. Achab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered together
the prophets unto mount Carmel.</p>

<p>18:21. And Elias coming to all the people, said: How long do you halt
between two sides? &nbsp;If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then
follow him. &nbsp;And the people did not answer him a word.</p>

<p>18:22. And Elias said again to the people: I only remain a prophet of
the Lord: but the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men.</p>

<p>18:23. Let two bullocks be given us, and let them choose one bullock for
themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it upon wood, but put no fire
under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put
no fire under it.</p>

<p>18:24. Call ye on the names of your gods, and I will call on the name of
my Lord: and the God that shall answer by fire, let him be God. &nbsp;And all
the people answering, said: A very good proposal.</p>

<p>18:25. Then Elias said to the prophets of Baal: Choose you one bullock
and dress it first, because you are many: and call on the names of your
gods; but put no fire under.</p>

<p>18:26. And they took the bullock, which he gave them, and dressed it:
and they called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon,
saying: O Baal, hear us. &nbsp;But there was no voice, nor any that answered:
and they leaped over the altar that they had made.</p>

<p>18:27. And when it was now noon, Elias jested at them, saying: Cry with
a louder voice: &nbsp;for he is a god; and perhaps he is talking, or is in an
inn, or on a journey; or perhaps he is asleep, and must be awaked.</p>

<p>18:28. So they cried with a loud voice, and cut themselves after their
manner with knives and lancets, till they were all covered with blood.</p>

<p>18:29. And after midday was past, and while they were prophesying, the
time was come of offering sacrifice, and there was no voice heard, nor
did any one answer, nor regard them as they prayed.</p>

<p>18:30. Elias said to all the people: Come ye unto me. &nbsp;And the people
coming near unto him, he repaired the altar of the Lord, that was broken
down:</p>

<p>18:31. And he took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes
of the sons of Jacob to whom the word of the Lord came, saying: &nbsp;Israel
shall be thy name.</p>

<p>18:32. And he built with the stones an altar to the name of the Lord:
and he made a trench for water, of the breadth of two furrows, round
about the altar.</p>

<p>18:33. And he laid the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and
laid it upon the wood.</p>

<p>18:34. And he said: Fill four buckets with water, and pour it upon the
burnt offering, and upon the wood. &nbsp;And again he said: Do the same the
second time. And when they had done it the second time, he said: Do the
same also the third time. &nbsp;And they did so the third time.</p>

<p>18:35. And the water run round about the altar, and the trench was
filled with water.</p>

<p>18:36. And when it was now time to offer the holocaust, Elias, the
prophet, came near and said: O Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and
Israel, shew this day that thou art the God of Israel, and I thy
servant, and that according to thy commandment I have done all these
things.</p>

<p>18:37. Dear me, O Lord, hear me: that this people may learn that thou
art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart again.</p>

<p>18:38. Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the holocaust, and
the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was
in the trench.</p>

<p>18:39. And when all the people saw this, they fell on their faces, and
they said: The Lord, he is God; the Lord, he is God.</p>

<p>18:40. And Elias said to them: Take the prophets of Baal, and let not
one of them escape. And when they had taken them, Elias brought them
down to the torrent Cison, and killed them there.</p>

<p>18:41. And Elias said to Achab: Go up, eat and drink: for there is a
sound of abundance of rain.</p>

<p>18:42. Achab went up to eat and drink: and Elias went up to the top of
Carmel, and casting himself down upon the earth, put his face between
his knees,</p>

<p>18:43. And he said to his servant: Go up, and look towards the sea. And
he went up, and looked, and said: There is nothing. And again he said to
him: Return seven times.</p>

<p>18:44. And at the seventh time: Behold a little cloud arose out of the
sea like a man's foot. And he said: Go up, and say to Achab: Prepare thy
chariot, and go down, lest the rain prevent thee.</p>

<p>18:45. And while he turned himself this way and that way, behold the
heavens grew dark, with clouds and wind, and there fell a great rain.
And Achab getting up, went away to Jezrahel:</p>

<p>18:46. And the hand of the Lord was upon Elias, and he girded up his
loins, and ran before Achab, till he came to Jezrahel.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 19</p>

<p>Elias, fleeing from Jezabel, is fed by an angel in the desert; and by
the strength of that food walketh forty days, till he cometh to Horeb,
where he hath a vision of God.</p>

<p>19:1. And Achab told Jezabel all that Elias had done, and how he had
slain all the prophets with the sword.</p>

<p>19:2. And Jezabel sent a messenger to Elias, saying: Such and such
things may the gods do to me, and add still more, if by this hour to
morrow I make not thy life as the life of one of them.</p>

<p>19:3. Then Elias was afraid, and rising up, he went whithersoever he had
a mind: and he came to Bersabee of Juda, and left his servant there,</p>

<p>19:4. And he went forward, one day's journey into the desert. And when
he was there, and sat under a juniper tree, he requested for his soul
that he might die, and said: It is enough for me, Lord; take away my
soul: for I am no better than my fathers.</p>

<p>That he might die... Elias requested to die, not out of impatience or
pusillanimity, but out of zeal against sin; and that he might no longer
be witness of the miseries of his people; and the war they were waging
against God and his servants. See ver. 10.</p>

<p>19:5. And he cast himself down, and slept in the shadow of the juniper
tree: and behold an angel of the Lord touched him, and said to him:
Arise and eat.</p>

<p>19:6. He looked, and behold there was at his head a hearth cake, and a
vessel of water: and he ate and drank, and he fell asleep again.</p>

<p>19:7. And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched
him, and said to him: Arise, eat: for thou hast yet a great way to go.</p>

<p>19:8. And he arose, and ate and drank, and walked in the strength of
that food forty days and forty nights, unto the mount of God, Horeb.</p>

<p>In the strength of that food, etc... This bread, with which Elias was
fed in the wilderness, was a figure of the bread of life which we
receive in the blessed sacrament; by the strength of which we are to be
supported in our journey through the wilderness of this world till we
come to the true mountain of God, and his vision in a happy eternity.</p>

<p>19:9. And when he was come thither, he abode in a cave and behold the
word of the Lord came unto him, and he said to him: What dost thou here,
Elias?</p>

<p>19:10. And he answered: With zeal have I been zealous for the Lord God
of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant: they
have thrown down thy altars, they have slain thy prophets with the
sword, and I alone am left, and they seek my life to take it away.</p>

<p>I alone am left... Viz., of the prophets in the kingdom of Israel, or of
the ten tribes; for in the kingdom of Juda religion was at that time in
a very flourishing condition under the kings Asa and Josaphat. And even
in Israel there remained several prophets, though not then known to
Elias. See chap. 20.13, 28, 35.</p>

<p>19:11. And he said to him: Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the
Lord: and behold the Lord passeth, and a great and strong wind before
the Lord, overthrowing the mountains, and breaking the rocks in pieces:
but the Lord is not in the wind. And after the wind, an earthquake: but
the Lord is not in the earthquake.</p>

<p>19:12. And after the earthquake, a fire: but the Lord is not in the
fire. And after the fire, a whistling of a gentle air.</p>

<p>19:13. And when Elias heard it, he covered his face with his mantle, and
coming forth, stood in the entering in of the cave, and behold a voice
unto him, saying: What dost thou here, Elias? And he answered:</p>

<p>19:14. With zeal have I been zealous for the Lord God of hosts: because
the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant: they have destroyed
thy altars, they have slain thy prophets with the sword; and I alone am
left, and they seek my life to take it away.</p>

<p>19:15. And the Lord said to him: Go, and return on thy way, through the
desert, to Damascus: and when thou art come thither, thou shalt anoint
Hazael to be king over Syria;</p>

<p>19:16. And thou shalt anoint Jehu, the son of Namsi, to be king over
Israel: and Eliseus, the son of Saphat, of Abelmeula, thou shalt anoint
to be prophet in thy room.</p>

<p>19:17. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall escape the sword
of Hazael, shall be slain by Jehu: and whosoever shall escape the sword
of Jehu, shall be slain by Eliseus.</p>

<p>Shall be slain by Eliseus... Eliseus did not kill any of the idolaters
with the material sword: but he is here joined with Hazael and Jehu, the
great instruments of God in punishing the idolatry of Israel, because he
foretold to the former his exaltation to the kingdom of Syria, and the
vengeance he would execute against Israel, and anointed the latter by
one of his disciples to be king of Israel, with commission to extirpate
the house of Achab.</p>

<p>19:18. And I will leave me seven thousand men in Israel, whose knees
have not been bowed before Baal, and every mouth that hath not
worshipped him, kissing the hands.</p>

<p>19:19. And Elias departing from thence, found Eliseus, the son of
Saphat, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen: and he was one of them that
were ploughing with, twelve yoke of oxen: and when Elias came up to him,
he cast his mantle upon him.</p>

<p>19:20. And he forthwith left the oxen, and run after Elias, and said:
Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will
follow thee. And he said to him: Go, and return back: for that which was
my part, I have done to thee.</p>

<p>19:21. And returning back from him, he took a yoke of oxen, and killed
them, and boiled the flesh with the plough of the oxen, and gave to the
people, and they ate: and rising up, he went away, and followed Elias,
and ministered to him.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 20</p>

<p>The Syrians besiege Samaria: they are twice defeated by Achab: who is
reprehended by a prophet for letting Benadad go.</p>

<p>20:1. And Benadad, king of Syria, gathered together all his host, and
there were two and thirty kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and
going up, he fought against Samaria, and besieged it.</p>

<p>20:2. And sending messengers to Achab, king of Israel, into the city,</p>

<p>20:3. He said: Thus saith Benadad: Thy silver and thy gold is mine: and
thy wives and thy goodliest children are mine.</p>

<p>20:4. And the king of Israel answered: According to thy word, my lord, O
king, I am thine, and all that I have.</p>

<p>20:5. And the messengers came again, and said: Thus saith Benadad, who
sent us unto thee: Thy silver and thy gold, and thy wives and thy
children, thou shalt deliver up to me.</p>

<p>20:6. To morrow, therefore, at this same hour, I will send my servants
to thee, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy
servants: and all that pleaseth them, they shall put in their hands, and
take away.</p>

<p>20:7. And the king of Israel called all the ancients of the land, and
said: Mark, and see that he layeth snares for us. For he sent to me for
my wives, and for my children, and for my silver and gold: and I said
not nay.</p>

<p>20:8. And all the ancients, and all the people said to him: Hearken not
to him, nor consent to him.</p>

<p>20:9. Wherefore he answered the messengers of Benadad: Tell my lord, the
king: All that thou didst send for to me, thy servant at first, I will
do: but this thing I cannot do.</p>

<p>20:10. And the messengers returning brought him word. &nbsp;And he sent
again, and said: Such and such things may the gods do to me, and more
may they add, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all
the people that follow me.</p>

<p>20:11. And the king of Israel answering, said: Tell him: Let not the
girded boast himself as the ungirded.</p>

<p>Let not the girded, etc... Let him not boast before the victory: it will
then be time to glory when he putteth off his armour, having overcome
his adversary.</p>

<p>20:12. And it came to pass, when Benadad heard this word, that he and
the kings were drinking in pavilions, and he said to his servants: Beset
the city. And they beset it.</p>

<p>20:13. And behold a prophet coming to Achab, king of Israel, said to
him: &nbsp;Thus saith the Lord: Hast thou seen all this exceeding great
multitude? behold I will deliver them into thy hand this day: that thou
mayst know that I am the Lord.</p>

<p>20:14. And Achab said: By whom? And he said to him: Thus saith the Lord:
By the servants of the princes of the provinces. And he said: Who shall
begin to fight? And he said: Thou.</p>

<p>20:15. So he mustered the servants of the princes of the provinces, and
he found the number of two hundred and thirty-two: &nbsp;and he mustered
after them the people, all the children of Israel, seven thousand:</p>

<p>20:16. And they went out at noon. But Benadad was drinking himself drunk
in his pavilion, and the two and thirty kings with him, who were come to
help him.</p>

<p>20:17. And the servants of the princes of the provinces went out first.
And Benadad sent. &nbsp;And they told him, saying: There are men come out of
Samaria.</p>

<p>20:18. And he said: Whether they come for peace, take them alive: or
whether they come to fight, take them alive.</p>

<p>20:19. So the servants of the princes of the provinces went out, and the
rest of the army followed:</p>

<p>20:20. And every one slew the man that came against him: and the Syrians
fled, and Israel pursued after them. &nbsp;And Benadad, king of Syria, fled
away on horseback with his horsemen.</p>

<p>20:21. But the king of Israel going out overthrew the horses and
chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.</p>

<p>20:22. (And a prophet coming to the king of Israel, said to him: Go, and
strengthen thyself, and know, and see what thou dost: for the next year
the king of Syria will come up against thee.)</p>

<p>20:23. But the servants of the king of Syria said to him: Their gods are
gods of the hills, therefore they have overcome us: but it is better
that we should fight against them in the plains, and we shall overcome
them.</p>

<p>20:24. Do thou, therefore, this thing: Remove all the kings from thy
army, and put captains in their stead:</p>

<p>20:25. And make up the number of soldiers that have been slain of thine,
and horses, according to the former horses, and chariots, according to
the chariots which thou hadst before: and we will fight against them in
the plains, and thou shalt see that we shall overcome them. He believed
their counsel, and did so.</p>

<p>20:26. Wherefore, at the return of the year, Benadad mustered the
Syrians, and went up to Aphec, to fight against Israel.</p>

<p>20:27. And the children of Israel were mustered, and taking victuals,
went out on the other side, and encamped over against them, like two
little flocks of goats: but the Syrians filled the land.</p>

<p>20:28. (And a man of God coming, said to the king of Israel: Thus saith
the Lord: &nbsp;Because the Syrians have said: The Lord is God of the hills,
but is not God of the valleys: I will deliver all this great multitude
into thy hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord.)</p>

<p>20:29. And both sides set their armies in array one against the other
seven days, and on the seventh day the battle was fought: and the
children of Israel slew, of the Syrians, a hundred thousand footmen in
one day.</p>

<p>20:30. And they that remained fled to Aphec, into the city: and the wall
fell upon seven and twenty thousand men, that were left. &nbsp;And Benadad
fleeing, went into the city, into a chamber that was within a chamber.</p>

<p>20:31. And his servants said to him: Behold, we have heard that the
kings of the house of Israel are merciful; so let us put sackcloths on
our loins, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel:
perhaps he will save our lives.</p>

<p>20:32. So they girded sackcloths on their loins, and put ropes on their
heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said to him: Thy servant,
Benadad, saith: I beseech thee let me have my life. And he said: If he
be yet alive, he is my brother.</p>

<p>20:33. The men took this for good luck: and in haste caught the word out
of his mouth, and said: Thy brother Benadad. And he said to them: Go,
and bring him to me. Then Benadad came out to him, and he lifted him up
into his chariot.</p>

<p>20:34. And he said to him: The cities which my father took from thy
father, I will restore: and do thou make thee streets in Damascus, as my
father made in Samaria and having made a league, I will depart from
thee. So he made a league with him, and let him go.</p>

<p>20:35. Then a certain man of the sons of the prophets, said to his
companion, in the word of the Lord: Strike me. But he would not strike.</p>

<p>20:36. Then he said to him: Because thou wouldst not hearken to the word
of the Lord, behold thou shalt depart from me, and a lion shall slay
thee. &nbsp;And when he was gone a little from him, a lion found him, and
slew him.</p>

<p>20:37. Then he found another man, and said to him: Strike me. And he
struck him and wounded him.</p>

<p>20:38. So the prophet went, and met the king in the way, and disguised
himself by sprinkling dust on his face and his eyes.</p>

<p>20:39. And as the king passed by, he cried to the king, and said: Thy
servant went out to fight hand to hand: and when a certain man was run
away, one brought him to me, and said: Keep this man: and if he shall
slip away, thy life shall be for his life, or thou shalt pay a talent of
silver.</p>

<p>20:40. And whilst I, in the hurry, turned this way and that, on a sudden
he was not to be seen. And the king of Israel said to him: This is thy
judgment, which thyself hast decreed.</p>

<p>20:41. But he forthwith wiped off the dust from his face, and the king
of Israel knew him, that he was one of the prophets.</p>

<p>20:42. And he said to him: Thus saith the Lord. Because thou hast let go
out of thy hand a man worthy of death, thy life shall be for his life,
and thy people for his people.</p>

<p>20:43. And the king of Israel returned to his house, slighting to hear,
and raging came into Samaria.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 21</p>

<p>Naboth, for denying his vineyard to king Achab, is by Jezabel's
commandment, falsely accused and stoned to death. For which crime Elias
denounceth to Achab the judgments of God: upon his humbling himself the
sentence is mitigated.</p>

<p>21:1. And after these things, Naboth the Jezrahelite, who was in
Jezrahel, had at that time a vineyard, near the palace of Achab, king of
Samaria.</p>

<p>21:2. And Achab spoke to Naboth, saying: Give me thy vineyard, that I
may make me a garden of herbs, because it is nigh, and adjoining to my
house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard: or if thou think
it more convenient for thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.</p>

<p>21:3. Naboth answered him: The Lord be merciful to me, and not let me
give thee the inheritance of my fathers.</p>

<p>21:4. And Achab came into his house angry and fretting, because of the
word that Naboth, the Jezrahelite, had spoken to him, saying: I will not
give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And casting himself upon his
bed, he turned away his face to the wall, and would eat no bread.</p>

<p>21:5. And Jezabel, his wife, went in to him, and said to him: What is
the matter that thy soul is so grieved? &nbsp;and why eatest thou no bread?</p>

<p>21:6. And he answered her: I spoke to Naboth, the Jezrahelite, and said
to him: &nbsp;Give me thy vineyard, and take money for it: or if it please
thee, I will give thee a better vineyard for it. And he said: I will not
give thee my vineyard.</p>

<p>21:7. Then Jezabel, his wife, said to him. Thou art of great authority
indeed, and governest well the kingdom of Israel. &nbsp;Arise, and eat bread,
and be of good cheer; I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth, the
Jezrahelite.</p>

<p>21:8. So she wrote letters in Achab's name, and sealed them with his
ring, and sent them to the ancients, and the chief men that were in his
city, and that dwelt with Naboth.</p>

<p>21:9. And this was the tenor of the letters: Proclaim a fast, and make
Naboth sit among the chief of the people;</p>

<p>21:10. And suborn two men, sons of Belial, against him and let them
bear false witness; that he hath blasphemed God and the king: and then
carry him out, and stone him, and so let him die.</p>

<p>21:11. And the men of his city, the ancients and nobles, that dwelt with
him in the city, did as Jezabel had commanded them, and as it was
written in the letters which she had sent to them;</p>

<p>21:12. They proclaimed a fast, and made Naboth sit among the chief of
the people.</p>

<p>21:13. And bringing two men, sons of the devil, they made them sit
against him: and they, like men of the devil, bore witness against him
before the people: saying: Naboth hath blasphemed God and the king.
Wherefore they brought him forth without the city, and stoned him to
death.</p>

<p>21:14. And they sent to Jezabel, saying: Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</p>

<p>21:15. And it came to pass, when Jezabel heard that Naboth was stoned,
and dead, that she said to Achab: Arise, and take possession of the
vineyard of Naboth, the Jezrahelite, who would not agree with thee, and
give it thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</p>

<p>21:16. And when Achab heard this, to wit, that Naboth was dead, he
arose, and went down into the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezrahelite, to
take possession of it.</p>

<p>21:17. And the word of the Lord came to Elias, the Thesbite, saying:</p>

<p>21:18. Arise, and go down to meet Achab, king of Israel, who is in
Samaria: behold he is going down to the vineyard of Naboth, to take
possession of it:</p>

<p>21:19. And thou shalt speak to him, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Thou
hast slain: moreover also thou hast taken possession. &nbsp;And after these
words thou shalt add: Thus saith the Lord: In this place, wherein the
dogs have licked the blood of Naboth, they shall lick thy blood also.</p>

<p>21:20. And Achab said to Elias: Hast thou found me thy enemy? &nbsp;He said:
I have found thee because thou art sold, to do evil in the sight of the
Lord.</p>

<p>Sold, to do evil in the sight, etc... That is, so addicted to evil, as
if thou hadst sold thyself to the devil, to be his slave to work all
kinds of evil.</p>

<p>21:21. Behold I will bring evil upon thee, and I will cut down thy
posterity, and I will kill of Achab him that pisseth against the wall,
and him that is shut up, and the last in Israel.</p>

<p>21:22. And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of
Nabat, and like the house of Baasa the son of Ahias: for what thou hast
done to provoke me to anger, and for making Israel to sin.</p>

<p>21:23. &nbsp;And of Jezabel also, the Lord spoke, saying: The dogs shall eat
Jezabel in the field of Jezrahel.</p>

<p>21:24. If Achab die in the city, the dogs shall eat him: but if he die
in the field, the birds of the air shall eat him.</p>

<p>21:25. Now, there was not such another as Achab, who was sold to do evil
in the sight of the Lord: for his wife, Jezabel, set him on,</p>

<p>21:26. And he became abominable, insomuch that he followed the idols
which the Amorrhites had made, whom the Lord destroyed before the face
of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>21:27. And when Achab had heard these words, he rent his garments, and
put haircloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and slept in sackcloth, and
walked with his head cast down.</p>

<p>21:28. And the word of the Lord came to Elias, the Thesbite, saying:</p>

<p>21:29. Hast thou not seen Achab humbled before me? therefore, because he
hath humbled himself, for my sake, I will not bring the evil in his
days, but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.</p>

<p>3 Kings Chapter 22</p>

<p>Achab believing his false prophets, rather than Micheas, is slain in
Ramoth Galaad. &nbsp;Ochozias succeedeth him. &nbsp;Good king Josaphat dieth, and
his son Joram succeedeth him.</p>

<p>22:1. And there passed three years without war between Syria and Israel.</p>

<p>22:2. And in the third year, Josaphat, king of Juda, came down to the
king of Israel.</p>

<p>22:3. (And the king of Israel said to his servants: Know ye not that
Ramoth Galaad is ours, and we neglect to take it out of the hand of the
king of Syria?)</p>

<p>22:4. And he said to Josaphat: Wilt thou come with me to battle to
Ramoth Galaad?</p>

<p>22:5. And Josaphat said to the king of Israel: As I am, so art thou: my
people and thy people are one: and my horsemen are thy horsemen. And
Josaphat said to the king of Israel: Inquire, I beseech thee, this day
the word of the Lord.</p>

<p>22:6. Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred
men, and he said to them: Shall I go to Ramoth Galaad to fight, or shall
I forbear? &nbsp;They answered: Go up, and the Lord will deliver it into the
hand of the king.</p>

<p>22:7. And Josaphat said: Is there not here some prophet of the Lord,
that we may inquire by him?</p>

<p>22:8. And the king of Israel said to Josaphat. There is one man left, by
whom we may inquire of the Lord; Micheas, the son of Jemla: but I hate
him, for he doth not prophecy good to me, but evil. And Josaphat said:
Speak not so, O king.</p>

<p>22:9. Then the king of Israel called an eunuch, and said to him: Make
haste, and bring hither Micheas, the son of Jemla.</p>

<p>22:10. And the king of Israel, and Josaphat, king of Juda, sat each on
his throne, clothed with royal robes, in a court, by the entrance of the
gate of Samaria, and all the prophets prophesied before them.</p>

<p>22:11. And Sedecias, thc son of Chanaana, made himself horns of iron,
and said: Thus saith the Lord: With these shalt thou push Syria, till
thou destroy it.</p>

<p>22:12. And all the prophets prophesied in like manner, saying: Go up to
Ramoth Galaad, and prosper, for the Lord will deliver it into the king's
hands.</p>

<p>22:13. And the messenger that went to call Micheas, spoke to him,
saying: Behold the words of the prophets with one mouth declare good
things to the king: let thy word, therefore, be like to theirs, and
speak that which is good.</p>

<p>22:14. But Micheas said to him: As the Lord liveth, whatsoever the Lord
shall say to me, that will I speak.</p>

<p>22:15. So he came to the king, and the king said to him: Micheas, shall
we go to Ramoth Galaad to battle, or shall we forbear? &nbsp;He answered him:
Go up, and prosper, and the Lord shall deliver it into the king's hands.</p>

<p>Go up, etc... This was spoken ironically, and by way of jesting at the
flattering speeches of the false prophets: and so the king understood
it, as appears by his adjuring Micheas, in the following verse, to tell
him the truth in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>22:16. But the king said to him: I adjure thee again and again, that
thou tell me nothing but that which is true, in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>22:17. And he said: I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, like
sheep that have no shepherd; and the Lord said: These have no master:
let every man of them return to his house in peace.</p>

<p>22:18. (Then the king of Israel said to Josaphat: Did I not tell thee,
that he prophesieth no good to me, but always evil?)</p>

<p>22:19. And he added and said: Hear thou, therefore, the word of the
Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven
standing by him on the right hand and on the left:</p>

<p>22:20. And the Lord said: Who shall deceive Achab, king of Israel, that
he may go up, and fall at Ramoth Galaad? And one spoke words of this
manner, and another otherwise.</p>

<p>The Lord said, etc... God standeth not in need of any counsellor; nor
are we to suppose that things pass in heaven in the manner here
described: but this representation was made to the prophet, to be
delivered by him in a manner adapted to the common ways and notions of
men.</p>

<p>22:21. And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and
said: I will deceive him. And the Lord said to him: By what means?</p>

<p>22:22. And he said: I will go forth, and be a lying spirit, in the mouth
of all his prophets. And the Lord said: Thou shalt deceive him, and
shalt prevail: go forth, and do so.</p>

<p>Go forth, and do so... This was not a command, but a permission: for God
never ordaineth lies; though he often permitteth the lying spirit to
deceive those who love not the truth. 2 Thess. 2.10. And in this sense
it is said in the following verse, The Lord hath given a lying spirit in
the mouth of all thy prophets.</p>

<p>22:23. Now, therefore, behold the Lord hath given a lying spirit in the
mouth of all thy prophets that are here, and the Lord hath spoken evil
against thee.</p>

<p>22:24. And Sedecias, the son of Chanaana, came, and struck Micheas on
the cheek, and said: Hath then the spirit of the Lord left me, and
spoken to thee?</p>

<p>22:25. And Micheas said: Thou shalt see in the day when thou shalt go
into a chamber within a chamber to hide thyself.</p>

<p>Go into a chamber, etc... This happened when he heard the king was
slain, and justly apprehended that he should be punished for his false
prophecy.</p>

<p>22:26. And the king of Israel said: Take Micheas and let him abide with
Amon, the governor of the city, and with Joas, the son of Amalech;</p>

<p>22:27. And tell them: Thus saith the king: Put this man in prison, and
feed him with bread of affliction, and water of distress till I return
in peace.</p>

<p>22:28. And Micheas said: If thou return in peace, the Lord hath not
spoken by me. And he said: Hear, all ye people.</p>

<p>22:29. So the king of Israel, and Josaphat, king of Juda, went up to
Ramoth-Galaad.</p>

<p>22:30. And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: Take thy armour, and go
into the battle, and put on thy own garments. &nbsp;But the king of Israel
changed his dress, and went into the battle.</p>

<p>22:31. And the king of Syria had commanded the two and thirty captains
of the chariots, saying: You shall not fight against any, small or
great, but against the king of Israel only.</p>

<p>22:32. So when the captains of the chariots saw Josaphat, they suspected
that he was the king of Israel, and making a violent assault, they
fought against him: and Josaphat cried out.</p>

<p>22:33. And the captains of the chariots perceived that he was not the
king of Israel, and they turned away from him.</p>

<p>22:34. And a certain man bent his bow, shooting at a venture, and
chanced to strike the king of Israel, between the lungs and the stomach.
But he said to the driver of his chariot: Turn thy hand, and carry me
out of the army, for I am grievously wounded.</p>

<p>22:35. And the battle was fought that day, and the king of Israel stood
in his chariot against the Syrians, and he died in the evening: and the
blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</p>

<p>22:36. And the herald proclaimed through all the army, before the sun
set, saying: Let every man return to his own city, and to his own
country.</p>

<p>22:37. And the king died, and was carried into Samaria: and they buried
the king in Samaria.</p>

<p>22:38. And they washed his chariot in the pool of Samaria and the dogs
licked up his blood, and they washed the reins according to the word of
the Lord which he had spoken.</p>

<p>22:39. But the rest of the acts of Achab, and all that he did, and the
house of ivory that he made, and all the cities that he built, are they
not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</p>

<p>22:40. So Achab slept with his fathers; and Ochozias, his son, reigned
in his stead.</p>

<p>22:41. But Josaphat, the son of Asa, began to reign over Juda, in the
fourth year of Acbab, king of Israel.</p>

<p>22:42. He was five and thirty years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned five and twenty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was
Azuba, the daughter of Salai.</p>

<p>22:43. And he walked in all the way of Asa, his father, and he declined
not from it: and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord.</p>

<p>22:44. Nevertheless, he took not away the high places for as yet the
people offered sacrifice, and burnt incense in the high places.</p>

<p>He took not away, etc... He left some of the high places, viz., those in
which they worshipped the true God: but took away all others, 2 Par.
17.6, and note ver. 14 of chap. 15. 3 Kings.</p>

<p>22:45. And Josaphat had peace with the king of Israel.</p>

<p>22:46. But the rest of the acts of Josaphat, and his works which he did,
and his battles, are they not written in the book of the words of the
days of the kings of Juda?</p>

<p>22:47. And the remnant also of the effeminate, who remained in the days
of Asa, his father, he took out of the land.</p>

<p>22:48. And there was then no king appointed in Edom.</p>

<p>22:49. But king Josaphat made navies on the sea, to sail into Ophir for
gold: but they could not go, for the ships were broken in Asiongaber.</p>

<p>22:50. Then Ochozias, the son of Achab, said to Josaphat: Let my
servants go with thy servants in the ships. &nbsp;And Josaphat would not.</p>

<p>Would not... He had been reprehended before for admitting such a
partner: and therefore would have no more to do with him.</p>

<p>22:51. And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in
the city of David, his father: and Joram, his son, reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>22:52. And Ochozias, the son of Achab, began to reign over Israel, in
Samaria, in the seventeenth year of Josaphat, king of Juda, and he
reigned over Israel two years.</p>

<p>22:53. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way
of his father and his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam, the son of
Nabat, who made Israel to sin.</p>

<p>22:54. He served also Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked the Lord,
the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
