<p>THE PROPHECY OF AGGEUS</p>

<p>AGGEUS was one of those that returned from the captivity of Babylon, in
the first year of the reign of king Cyrus. He was sent by the Lord, in
the second year of the reign of king Darius, the son of Hystaspes, to
exhort Zorobabel the prince of Juda, and Jesus the high priest, to the
building of the temple; which they had begun, but left off again through
the opposition of the Samaritans. In consequence of this exhortation
they proceeded in the building and finished the temple. And the prophet
was commissioned by the Lord to assure them that this second temple
should be more glorious than the former, because the Messiah should
honour it with his presence: signifying withal how much the church of
the New Testament should excel that of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>
Aggeus Chapter 1</p>

<p>The people are reproved for neglecting to build the temple. They are
encouraged to set about the work.</p>

<p>1:1. In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the
first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus
the prophet, to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, governor of Juda, and to
Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, saying:</p>

<p>1:2. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, saying: This people saith: The time
is not yet come for building the house of the Lord.</p>

<p>1:3. And the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus the prophet,
saying:</p>

<p>1:4. Is it time for you to dwell in ceiled houses, and this house lie
desolate?</p>

<p>1:5. And now thus saith the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts to consider
your ways.</p>

<p>1:6. You have sowed much, and brought in little: you have eaten, but
have not had enough: you have drunk, but have not been filled with
drink: you have clothed yourselves, but have not been warmed: and he
that hath earned wages, put them into a bag with holes.</p>

<p>1:7. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts upon your ways:</p>

<p>1:8. Go up to the mountain, bring timber, and build the house: and it
shall be acceptable to me, and I shall be glorified, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>1:9. You have looked for more, and behold it became less, and you
brought it home, and I blowed it away: why, saith the Lord of hosts?
because my house is desolate, and you make haste every man to his own
house.</p>

<p>1:10. Therefore the heavens over you were stayed from giving dew, and
the earth was hindered from yielding her fruits:</p>

<p>1:11. And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains,
and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon all
that the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon beasts, and upon
all the labour of the hands.</p>

<p>1:12. Then Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec
the high priest, and all the remnant of the people hearkened to the
voice of the Lord their God, and to the words of Aggeus the prophet, as
the Lord their God sent him to them: and the people feared before the
Lord.</p>

<p>1:13. And Aggeus the messenger of the Lord, as one of the messengers of
the Lord, spoke, saying to the people: I am with you, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>1:14. And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zorobabel the son of
Salathiel governor of Juda, and the spirit of Jesus the son of Josedec
the high priest, and the spirit of all the rest of the people: and they
went in, and did the work in the house of the Lord of Hosts their God.</p>

<p>Aggeus Chapter 2</p>

<p>Christ by his coming shall make the latter temple more glorious than the
former. The blessing of God shall reward their labour in building. God's
promise to Zorobabel.</p>

<p>2:1. In the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth month, in
the second year of Darius the king, they began.</p>

<p>2:2. And in the seventh month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of
Aggeus the prophet, saying:</p>

<p>2:3. Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel the governor of Juda, and
to Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and to the rest of the
people, saying:</p>

<p>2:4. Who is left among you, that saw this house in its first glory? and
how do you see it now? is it not in comparison to that as nothing in
your eyes?</p>

<p>2:5. Yet now take courage, O Zorobabel, saith the Lord, and take
courage, Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and take courage, all
ye people of the land, saith the Lord of hosts: and perform (for I am
with you, saith the Lord of hosts)</p>

<p>2:6. The word that I convenanted with you when you came out of the land
of Egypt: and my spirit shall be in the midst of you: fear not.</p>

<p>2:7. For thus saith the Lord of hosts: Yet one little while, and I will
move the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.</p>

<p>2:8. And I will move all nations: AND THE DESIRED OF ALL NATIONS SHALL
COME: and I will fill this house with glory: saith the Lord of hosts.</p>

<p>2:9. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>

<p>2:10. Great shall be the glory of this last house more than of the
first, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place I will give peace,
saith the Lord of hosts.</p>

<p>2:11. In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second
year of Darius the king, the word of the Lord came to Aggeus the
prophet, saying:</p>

<p>2:12. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Ask the priests the law, saying:</p>

<p>2:13. If a man carry sanctified flesh in the skirt of his garment, and
touch with his skirt, bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat:
shall it be sanctified? And the priests answered, and said: No.</p>

<p>2:14. And Aggeus said: If one that is unclean by occasion of a soul
touch any of all these things, shall it be defiled? And the priests
answered, and said: It shall be defiled.</p>

<p>By occasion of a soul... That is, by having touched the dead; in which
case, according to the prescription of the law, Num. 19.13, 22, a person
not only became unclean himself, but made every thing that he touched
unclean. The prophet applies all this to the people, whose souls
remained unclean by neglecting the temple of God; and therefore were not
sanctified by the flesh they offered in sacrifice: but rather defiled
their sacrifices by approaching to them in the state of uncleanness.</p>

<p>2:15. And Aggeus answered, and said: So is this people, and so is this
nation before my face, saith the Lord, and so is all the work of their
hands: and all that they have offered there, shall be defiled.</p>

<p>2:16. And now consider in your hearts, from this day and upward, before
there was a stone laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord.</p>

<p>2:17. When you went to a heap of twenty bushels, and they became ten:
and you went into the press, to press out fifty vessels, and they became
twenty.</p>

<p>2:18. I struck you with a blasting wind, and all the works of your hand
with the mildew and with hail, yet there was none among you that
returned to me, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>2:19. Set your hearts from this day, and henceforward, from the four and
twentieth day of the ninth month: from the day that the foundations of
the temple of the Lord were laid, and lay it up in your hearts.</p>

<p>2:20. Is the seed as yet sprung up? or hath the vine, and the fig tree,
and the pomegranate, and the olive tree as yet flourished? from this day
I will bless you.</p>

<p>2:21. And the word of the Lord came a second time to Aggeus in the four
and twentieth day of the month, saying:</p>

<p>2:22. Speak to Zorobabel the governor of Juda, saying: I will move both
heaven and earth.</p>

<p>2:23. And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and will destroy the
strength of the kingdom of the Gentiles: and I will overthrow the
chariot, and him that rideth therin: and the horses and their riders
shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.</p>

<p>2:24. In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, I will take thee, O
Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, my servant, saith the Lord, and will
make thee as a signet, for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>

<p>O Zorobabel... This promise principally relates to Christ, who was of
the race of Zorobabel.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
