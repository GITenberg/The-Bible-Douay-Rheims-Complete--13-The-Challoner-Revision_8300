<h1>Book 67 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Peter</h1>





<p>THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE</p>

<p>The first Epistle of St. Peter, though brief, contains much doctrine
concerning Faith, Hope, and Charity, with divers instructions to all
persons of what state or condition soever. &nbsp;The Apostle commands
submission to rulers and superiors and exhorts all to the practice of a
virtuous life in imitation, of Christ. This Epistle is written with such
apostolical dignity as to manifest the supreme authority with which its
writer, the Prince of the Apostles, had been vested by his Lord and
Master, Jesus Christ. He wrote it at Rome, which figuratively he calls
Babylon, about fifteen years after our Lord's Ascension.</p>

<p>
1 Peter Chapter 1</p>

<p>He gives thanks to God for the benefit of our being called to the true
faith and to eternal life, into which we are to enter by many
tribulations. He exhorts to holiness of life, considering the holiness
of God and our redemption by the blood of Christ.</p>

<p>1:1. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers dispersed
through Pontus, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, elect,</p>

<p>1:2. According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, unto the
sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood
of Jesus Christ. Grace unto you and peace be multiplied.</p>

<p>1:3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
according to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope, by
the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead:</p>

<p>1:4. Unto an inheritance, incorruptible, and undefiled and that cannot
fade, reserved in heaven for you,</p>

<p>1:5. Who, by the power of God, are kept by faith unto salvation, ready
to be revealed in the last time.</p>

<p>1:6. Wherein you shalt greatly rejoice, if now you must be for a little
time made sorrowful in divers temptations:</p>

<p>1:7. That the trial of your faith (much more precious than gold which is
tried by the fire) may be found unto praise and glory and honour at the
appearing of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>1:8. Whom having not seen, you love: in whom also now though you see him
not, you believe and, believing, shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and
glorified;</p>

<p>1:9. Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.</p>

<p>1:10. Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and diligently
searched, who prophesied of the grace to come in you.</p>

<p>1:11. Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them
did signify, when it foretold those sufferings that are in Christ and
the glories that should follow.</p>

<p>1:12. To whom it was revealed that, not to themselves but to you, they
ministered those things which are now declared to you by them that have
preached the gospel to you: the Holy Ghost being sent down from heaven,
on whom the angels desire to look.</p>

<p>1:13. Wherefore, having the loins of your mind girt up, being sober,
trust perfectly in the grace which is offered you in the revelation of
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>1:14. As children of obedience, not fashioned according to the former
desires of your ignorance,</p>

<p>1:15. But according to him that hath called you, who is holy, be you
also in all manner of conversation holy:</p>

<p>1:16. Because it is written: You shall be holy, for I am holy.</p>

<p>1:17. And if you invoke as Father him who, without respect of persons,
judgeth according to every one's work: converse in fear during the time
of your sojourning here.</p>

<p>1:18. Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as
gold or silver, from your vain conversation of the tradition of your
fathers:</p>

<p>1:19. But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and
undefiled.</p>

<p>1:20. Foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but
manifested in the last times for you:</p>

<p>1:21. Who through him are faithful in God who raised him up from the
dead and hath given him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.</p>

<p>1:22. Purifying your souls in the obedience of charity, with a brotherly
love, from a sincere heart love one another earnestly:</p>

<p>1:23. Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, by
the word of God who liveth and remaineth for ever.</p>

<p>1:24. For all flesh is as grass and all the glory thereof as the flower
of grass. The grass is withered and the flower thereof is fallen away.</p>

<p>1:25. But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
which by the gospel hath been preached unto you.</p>

<p>1 Peter Chapter 2</p>

<p>We are to lay aside all guile and go to Christ the living stone, and, as
being now his people, walk worthily of him, with submission to superiors
and patience under sufferings.</p>

<p>2:1. Wherefore laying away all malice and all guile and dissimulations
and envies and all detractions,</p>

<p>2:2. As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that
thereby you may grow unto salvation:</p>

<p>2:3. If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet.</p>

<p>2:4. Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men but
chosen and made honourable by God:</p>

<p>2:5. Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy
priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>2:6. Wherefore it is said in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a
chief corner stone, elect, precious. And he that shall believe in him
shall not be confounded.</p>

<p>2:7. To you therefore that believe, he is honour: but to them that
believe not, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the
head of the corner:</p>

<p>2:8. And a stone of stumbling and a rock of scandal, to them who stumble
at the word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set.</p>

<p>2:9. But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy
nation, a purchased people: that you may declare his virtues, who hath
called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:</p>

<p>2:10. Who in times past were not a people: but are now the people of
God. Who had not obtained mercy: but now have obtained mercy.</p>

<p>2:11. Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, to
refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul,</p>

<p>2:12. Having your conversation good among the Gentiles: that whereas
they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works which
they shall behold in you, glorify God in the day of visitation.</p>

<p>2:13. Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God's sake:
whether it be to the king as excelling,</p>

<p>2:14. Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and
for the praise of the good.</p>

<p>2:15. For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to
silence the ignorance of foolish men:</p>

<p>2:16. As free and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the
servants of God.</p>

<p>2:17. Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</p>

<p>2:18. Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to
the good and gentle but also to the froward.</p>

<p>2:19. For this is thankworthy: if, for conscience towards God, a man
endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully.</p>

<p>2:20. For what glory is it, if, committing sin and being buffeted for
it, you endure? But if doing well you suffer patiently: this is
thankworthy before God.</p>

<p>2:21. For unto this are you called: because Christ also suffered for us,
leaving you an example that you should follow his steps.</p>

<p>2:22. Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</p>

<p>2:23. Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he
threatened not, but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly.</p>

<p>2:24. Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree: that we,
being dead to sins, should live to justice: by whose stripes you were
healed.</p>

<p>2:25. For you were as sheep going astray: but you are now converted to
the shepherd and bishop of your souls.</p>

<p>1 Peter Chapter 3</p>

<p>How wives are to behave to their husbands. What ornaments they are to
seek. Exhortations to divers Virtues.</p>

<p>3:1. In like manner also, let wives be subject to their husbands: that,
if any believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the
conversation of the wives,</p>

<p>3:2. Considering your chaste conversation with fear.</p>

<p>3:3. Whose adorning, let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or
the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel:</p>

<p>3:4. But the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptibility of a quiet
and a meek spirit which is rich in the sight of God.</p>

<p>3:5. For after this manner heretofore, the holy women also who trusted
in God adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</p>

<p>3:6. As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are,
doing well and not fearing any disturbance.</p>

<p>3:7. Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge,
giving honour to the female as to the weaker vessel and as to the
co-heirs of the grace of life: that your prayers be not hindered.</p>

<p>3:8. And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of
another, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble:</p>

<p>3:9. Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but
contrariwise, blessing: for unto this are you called, that you may
inherit a blessing.</p>

<p>3:10. For he that will love life and see good days, let him refrain his
tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.</p>

<p>3:11. Let him decline from evil and do good: Let him seek after peace
and pursue it:</p>

<p>3:12. Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto
their prayers but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil
things.</p>

<p>3:13. And who is he that can hurt you, if you be zealous of good?</p>

<p>3:14. But if also you suffer any thing for justice' sake, blessed are
ye. And be not afraid of their fear: and be not troubled.</p>

<p>3:15. But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being ready always to
satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you.</p>

<p>3:16. But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience: that whereas
they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good
conversation in Christ.</p>

<p>3:17. For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer
than doing ill.</p>

<p>3:18. Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the
unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the
flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,</p>

<p>3:19. In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in
prison:</p>

<p>Spirits that were in prison... See here a proof of a third place, or
middle state of souls: for these spirits in prison, to whom Christ went
to preach, after his death, were not in heaven; nor yet in the hell of
the damned: because heaven is no prison: and Christ did not go to preach
to the damned.</p>

<p>3:20. Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the
patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein
a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.</p>

<p>3:21. Whereunto baptism, being of the like form, now saveth you also:
not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but, the examination of
a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Whereunto baptism, etc... Baptism is said to be of the like form with
the water by which Noe was saved, because the one was a figure of the
other. Not the putting away, etc... As much as to say, that baptism has
not its efficacy, in order to salvation, from its washing away any
bodily filth or dirt; but from its purging the conscience from sin, when
accompanied with suitable dispositions in the party, to answer the
interrogations made at that time, with relation to faith, the renouncing
of Satan with all his works; and the obedience to God's commandments.</p>

<p>3:22. Who is on the right hand of God, swallowing down death that we
might be made heirs of life everlasting: being gone into heaven, the
angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him.</p>

<p>1 Peter Chapter 4</p>

<p>Exhortations to cease from sin, to mutual charity, to do all for the
glory of God, to be willing to suffer for Christ.</p>

<p>4:1. Christ therefore having suffered in the flesh, be you also armed
with the same thought: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath
ceased from sins:</p>

<p>4:2. That now he may live the rest of his time in the flesh, not after
the desires of men but according to the will of God.</p>

<p>4:3. For the time past is sufficient to have fulfilled the will of the
Gentiles, for them who have walked in riotousness, lusts, excess of
wine, revellings, banquetings and unlawful worshipping of idols.</p>

<p>4:4. Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them into the
same confusion of riotousness: speaking evil of you.</p>

<p>4:5. Who shall render account to him who is ready to judge the living
and the dead.</p>

<p>4:6. For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to the dead: That
they might be judged indeed according to men, in the flesh: but may live
according to God, in the Spirit.</p>

<p>4:7. But the end of all is at hand. Be prudent therefore and watch in
prayers.</p>

<p>4:8. But before all things have a constant mutual charity among
yourselves: for charity covereth a multitude of sins.</p>

<p>4:9. Using hospitality one towards another, without murmuring,</p>

<p>4:10. As every man hath received grace, ministering the same one to
another: as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</p>

<p>4:11. If any man speak, let him speak, as the words of God. If any
minister, let him do it, as of the power which God administereth: that
in all things God may be honoured through Jesus Christ: to whom is glory
and empire for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>4:12. Dearly beloved, think not strange the burning heat which is to try
you: as if some new thing happened to you.</p>

<p>4:13. But if you partake of the sufferings of Christ, rejoice that, when
his glory shall be revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy.</p>

<p>4:14. If you be reproached for the name of Christ, you shall be blessed:
for that which is of the honour, glory and power of God, and that which
is his Spirit resteth upon you.</p>

<p>4:15. But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or a railer or
coveter of other men's things.</p>

<p>4:16. But, if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed: but let him
glorify God in that name.</p>

<p>4:17. For the time is, that judgment should begin at the house of God.
And if at first at us, what shall be the end of them that believe not
the gospel of God?</p>

<p>4:18. And if the just man shall scarcely be saved, where shall the
ungodly and the sinner appear?</p>

<p>Scarcely... That is, not without much labour and difficulty; and because
of the dangers which constantly surround, the temptations of the world,
of the devil, and of our own corrupt nature.</p>

<p>4:19. Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God
commend their souls in good deeds to the faithful Creator.</p>

<p>1 Peter Chapter 5</p>

<p>He exhorts both priests and laity to their respective duties and
recommends to all humility and watchfulness.</p>

<p>5:1. The ancients therefore that are among you, I beseech who am myself
also an ancient and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as also a
partaker of that glory which is to be revealed in time to come:</p>

<p>5:2. Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking care of it, not by
constraint but willingly, according to God: not for filthy lucre's sake
but voluntarily:</p>

<p>5:3. Neither as lording it over the clergy but being made a pattern of
the flock from the heart.</p>

<p>5:4. And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a
never fading crown of glory.</p>

<p>5:5. In like manner, ye young men, be subject to the ancients. And do
you all insinuate humility one to another: for God resisteth the proud,
but to the humble he giveth grace.</p>

<p>5:6. Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may
exalt you in the time of visitation:</p>

<p>5:7. Casting all your care upon him, for he hath care of you.</p>

<p>5:8. Be sober and watch: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring
lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour.</p>

<p>5:9. Whom resist ye, strong in faith: knowing that the same affliction
befalls, your brethren who are in the world.</p>

<p>5:10. But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, will himself
perfect you and confirm you and establish you.</p>

<p>5:11. To him be glory and empire, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>5:12. By Sylvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I think, I have
written briefly: beseeching and testifying that this is the true grace
of God, wherein you stand.</p>

<p>5:13. The church that is in Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth
you. And so doth my son, Mark.</p>

<p>5:14. Salute one another with a holy kiss. Grace be to all you who are
in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
