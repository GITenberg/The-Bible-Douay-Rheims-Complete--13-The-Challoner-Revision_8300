<p>THE PROPHECY OF JONAS</p>

<p>JONAS prophesied in the reign of JEREBOAM the second: as we learn from 4
Kings 14.25. To whom also he foretold his success in restoring all the
borders of Israel. He was of GETH OPHER in the tribe of ZABULON, and
consequently of GALILEE: which confutes that assertion of the Pharisees,
John 7.52, that no prophet ever rose out of GALILEE. He prophesied and
prefigured in his own person the death and resurrection of CHRIST: and
was the only one among the prophets that was sent to preach to the
Gentiles.</p>

<p>
Jonas Chapter 1</p>

<p>Jonas being sent to preach in Ninive, fleeth away by sea: a tempest
riseth: of which he being found, by lot, to be the cause, is cast into
the sea, which thereupon is calmed.</p>

<p>1:1. Now the word of the Lord came to Jonas, the son of Amathi, saying:</p>

<p>1:2. Arise and go to Ninive, the great city, and preach in it: For the
wickedness thereof is come up before me.</p>

<p>Nineve... The capital city of the Assyrian empire.</p>

<p>1:3. And Jonas rose up to flee into Tharsis from the face of the Lord,
and he went down to Joppe, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he
paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tharsis
from the face of the Lord,</p>

<p>Tharsis... Which some take to be Tharsus of Cilicia, others to be
Tartessus of Spain, others to be Carthage.</p>

<p>1:4. But the Lord sent a great wind to the sea: and a great tempest was
raised in the sea, and the ship was in danger to be broken.</p>

<p>1:5. And the mariners were afraid, and the men cried to their god: and
they cast forth the wares that were in the ship, into the sea, to
lighten it of them: and Jonas went down into the inner part of the ship,
and fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>A deep sleep... This is a lively image of the insensibility of sinners,
fleeing from God, and threatened on every side with his judgments: and
yet sleeping as if they were secure.</p>

<p>1:6. And the ship master came to him and said to him: Why art thou fast
asleep? rise up call upon thy God, if so be that God will think of us
that we may not perish.</p>

<p>1:7. And they said every one to his fellow: Come and let us cast lots,
that we may know why this evil is upon us. &nbsp;And they cast lots, and the
lot fell upon Jonas.</p>

<p>1:8. And they said to him: Tell us for what cause this evil is upon us,
what is thy business? of what country art thou? and whither goest thou?
or of what people art thou?</p>

<p>1:9. And he said to them: I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, and the
God of heaven, who made both the sea and the dry land.</p>

<p>1:10. And the men were greatly afraid, and they said to him: Why hast
thou done this? (For the men knew that he fled from the face of the
Lord: because he had told them.)</p>

<p>1:11. And they said to him: What shall we do with thee, that the sea may
be calm to us? for the sea flowed and swelled.</p>

<p>1:12. And he said to them: take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the
sea shall be calm to you: for I know for my sake this great tempest is
upon you.</p>

<p>1:13. And the men rowed hard to return the land, but they were not able:
because the sea tossed and swelled upon them.</p>

<p>1:14. And they cried to the Lord, and said: We beseech thee, O Lord let
us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood:
for thou, oh Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.</p>

<p>1:15. And they took Jonas, and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased
from raging.</p>

<p>1:16. And the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and sacrificed victims to
the Lord, and made vows.</p>

<p>Jonas Chapter 2</p>

<p>Jonas is swallowed up by a great fish: he prayeth with confidence in
God; and the fish casteth him out on the dry land.</p>

<p>2:1. Now the Lord prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonas: and Jonas
was in the belly of a fish for three days and three nights.</p>

<p>2:2. And Jonas prayed to the Lord, his God, out of the belly of the
fish.</p>

<p>2:3. And he said: I cried out of my affliction to the Lord, and he heard
me: I cried out of the belly of hell, and thou hast heard my voice.</p>

<p>2:4. And thou hast cast me forth into the deep, in the heart of the sea,
and a flood hast compassed me: all thy billows, and thy waves have
passed over me.</p>

<p>2:5. And I said: I am cast away out of the sight of thy eyes: but yet I
shall see the holy temple again.</p>

<p>2:6. The waters compassed me about even to the soul: the deep hath
closed me round about, the sea hath covered my head.</p>

<p>2:7. I went down to the lowest parts of the mountains: the bars of the
earth have shut me up for ever: and thou wilt bring up my life from
corruption, O Lord, my God.</p>

<p>2:8. When my soul was in distress within me, I remembered the Lord: that
my prayer may come to thee, unto the holy temple.</p>

<p>2:9. They that in vain observe vanities, forsake their own mercy.</p>

<p>2:10. But I with the voice of praise will sacrifice to thee: I will pay
whatsoever I have vowed for my salvation to the Lord.</p>

<p>2:11. And the Lord spoke to the fish: and it vomited out Jonas upon the
dry land.</p>

<p>Spoke to the fish... God's speaking to the fish, was nothing else but
his will, which all things obey.</p>

<p>Jonas Chapter 3</p>

<p>Jonas is sent again to preach in Ninive. Upon their fasting and
repentance, God recalleth the sentence by which they were to be
destroyed.</p>

<p>
3:1. And the word of the Lord came to Jonas the second time saying:</p>

<p>3:2. Arise, and go to Ninive, the great city: and preach in it the
preaching that I bid thee.</p>

<p>3:3. And Jonas arose, and went to Ninive, according to the word of the
Lord: now Ninive was a great city of three days' journey.</p>

<p>Of three days' journey... By the computation of some ancient historians,
Ninive was about fifty miles round: so that to go through all the chief
streets and public places was three days' journey.</p>

<p>3:4. And Jonas began to enter into the city one day's journey: and he
cried and said: Yet forty days and Ninive shall be destroyed.</p>

<p>3:5. And the men of Ninive believed in God: and they proclaimed a fast,
and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least.</p>

<p>3:6. And the word came to the king of Ninive: and he rose up out of his
throne, and cast away his robe from him, and was clothed in sackcloth,
and sat in ashes.</p>

<p>3:7. And he caused it to be proclaimed and published in Ninive, from the
mouth of the king and of his princes, saying: Let neither men nor
beasts, oxen, nor sheep taste anything: let them not feed, nor drink
water.</p>

<p>3:8. And let men and beasts be covered with sackcloth, and cry to the
Lord with all their strength, and let them turn every one from his evil
way, and from the iniquity that is in their hands.</p>

<p>3:9. Who can tell if God will turn, and forgive: and will turn away from
his fierce anger, and we shall not perish?</p>

<p>3:10. And God saw their works, that they were turned from their evil
way: and God had mercy with regard to the evil which he had said that he
would do to them, and he did it not.</p>

<p>Jonas Chapter 4</p>

<p>4:1. And Jonas was exceedingly troubled, and was angry:</p>

<p>Was exceedingly troubled, etc... His concern was lest he should pass for
a false prophet; or rather, lest God's word, by this occasion, might
come to be slighted and disbelieved.</p>

<p>4:2. And he prayed to the Lord, and said: I beseech thee, O Lord, is not
this what I said, when I was yet in my own country? therefore I went
before to flee into Tharsis: for I know that thou art a gracious and
merciful God, patient, and of much compassion, and easy to forgive evil.</p>

<p>4:3. And now, O Lord, I beseech thee take my life from me: for it is
better for me to die than to live.</p>

<p>4:4. And the Lord said: Dost thou think thou hast reason to be angry?</p>

<p>4:5. Then Jonas went out of the city, and sat toward the east side of
the city: and he made himself a booth there, and he sat under it in the
shadow, till he might see what would befall the city.</p>

<p>4:6. And the Lord God prepared an ivy, and it came up over the head of
Jonas, to be a shadow over his head, and to cover him (for he was
fatigued): and Jonas was exceeding glad of the ivy.</p>

<p>The Lord God prepared an ivy... Hederam. In the Hebrew it is Kikajon,
which some render a gourd: others a palmerist, or palma Christi.</p>

<p>4:7. But God prepared a worm, when the morning arose on the following
day: and it struck the ivy and it withered.</p>

<p>4:8. And when the sun was risen, the Lord commanded a hot and burning
wind: and the sun beat upon the head of Jonas, and he broiled with the
heat: and he desired for his soul that he might die, and said: It is
better for me to die than to live.</p>

<p>4:9. And the Lord said to Jonas: Dost thou think thou hast reason to be
angry, for the ivy? And he said: I am angry with reason even unto death.</p>

<p>4:10. And the Lord said: Thou art grieved for the ivy, for which thou
hast not laboured, nor made it to grow, which in one night came up, and
in one night perished.</p>

<p>4:11. And shall I not spare Ninive, that great city, in which there are
more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons, that know how to
distinguish between their right hand and their left, and many beasts?</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
