<h1>Book 62 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Timothy</h1>





<p>THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY</p>

<p>In this Epistle, the Apostle again instructs and admonishes Timothy in
what belonged to his office, as in the former; and also warns him to
shun the conversation of those who had erred from the truth, describing
at the same time their character, He tells him of his approaching death
and desires him to come speedily to him. It appears from this
circumstance that he wrote this second Epistle in the time of his last
imprisonment at Rome and not long before his martyrdom.</p>

<p>
2 Timothy Chapter 1</p>

<p>He admonishes him to stir up the grace he received by his ordination and
not to be discouraged at his sufferings, but to hold firm the sound
doctrine of the gospel.</p>

<p>1:1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, according to
the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus:</p>

<p>1:2. To Timothy, my dearly beloved son. Grace, mercy and peace, from God
the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<p>1:3. I give thanks to God, whom I serve from my forefathers, with a pure
conscience, that without ceasing I have a remembrance of thee in my
prayers, night and day.</p>

<p>1:4. Desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be
filled with joy:</p>

<p>1:5. Calling to mind that faith which is in thee unfeigned, which also
dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and in thy mother Eunice, and I am
certain that in thee also.</p>

<p>1:6. For which cause I admonish thee that thou stir up the grace of God
which is in thee by the imposition of my hands.</p>

<p>1:7. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear: but of power and of
love and of sobriety.</p>

<p>1:8. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of
me his prisoner: but labour with the gospel, according to the power of
God.</p>

<p>1:9. Who hath delivered us and called us by his holy calling, not
according to our own works, but according to his own purpose and grace,
which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of the world:</p>

<p>1:10. But is now made manifest by the illumination of our Saviour Jesus
Christ, who hath destroyed death and hath brought to light life and
incorruption by the gospel.</p>

<p>By the illumination... That is, by the bright coming and appearing of
our Saviour.</p>

<p>1:11. Wherein I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and teacher of
the Gentiles.</p>

<p>1:12. For which cause, I also suffer these things: but I am not ashamed.
For I know whom I have believed and I am certain that he is able to keep
that which I have committed unto him, against that day.</p>

<p>1:13. Hold the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me: in faith
and in the love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>1:14. Keep the good thing committed to thy trust by the Holy Ghost who
dwelleth in us.</p>

<p>1:15. Thou knowest this, that all they who are in Asia are turned away
from me: of whom are Phigellus and Hermogenes.</p>

<p>1:16. The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus: because he hath
often refreshed me and hath not been ashamed of my chain:</p>

<p>1:17. But when he was come to Rome, he carefully sought me and found me.</p>

<p>1:18. The Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day. And
in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou very well
knowest.</p>

<p>2 Timothy Chapter 2</p>

<p>He exhorts him to diligence in his office and patience in suffering. The
danger of the delusions of heretics.</p>

<p>2:1. Thou therefore, my son, be strong in Christ Jesus:</p>

<p>2:2. And the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, the
same commend to faithful men who shall be fit to teach others also.</p>

<p>2:3. Labour as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>2:4. No man, being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular
businesses: that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.</p>

<p>2:5. For he also that striveth for the mastery is not crowned, except he
strive lawfully.</p>

<p>2:6. The husbandman that laboureth must first partake of the fruits.</p>

<p>2:7. Understand what I say: for the Lord will give thee in all things
understanding.</p>

<p>2:8. Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the dead,
of the seed of David, according to my gospel:</p>

<p>2:9. Wherein I labour even unto bands, as an evildoer. But the word of
God is not bound.</p>

<p>2:10. Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they
also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly
glory.</p>

<p>2:11. A faithful saying: for if we be dead with him, we shall live also
with him.</p>

<p>2:12. If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. If we deny him, he
will also deny us.</p>

<p>2:13. If we believe not, he continueth faithful, he cannot deny himself.</p>

<p>2:14. Of these things put them in mind, charging them before the Lord.
Contend not in words: for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of
the hearers.</p>

<p>2:15. Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman
that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.</p>

<p>2:16. But shun profane and vain babblings: for they grow much towards
ungodliness.</p>

<p>2:17. And their speech spreadeth like a canker: of whom are Hymeneus and
Philetus:</p>

<p>2:18. Who have erred from the truth, saying that the resurrection is
past already, and have subverted the faith of some.</p>

<p>2:19. But the sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal:
the Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one depart from iniquity who
nameth the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>2:20. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
silver, but also of wood and of earth: and some indeed unto honour, but
some unto dishonour.</p>

<p>2:21. If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be
a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord, prepared
unto every good work.</p>

<p>2:22. But flee thou youthful desires, and pursue justice, faith, charity
and peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>

<p>2:23. And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget
strifes.</p>

<p>2:24. But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle: but be mild toward
all men, apt to teach, patient,</p>

<p>2:25. With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth: if
peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth;</p>

<p>2:26. And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil by
whom they are held captive at his will.</p>

<p>2 Timothy Chapter 3</p>

<p>The character of heretics of latter days. He exhorts Timothy to
constancy. Of the great profit of the knowledge of the scriptures.</p>

<p>3:1. Know also this, that in the last days shall come dangerous times.</p>

<p>3:2. Men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, haughty, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked,</p>

<p>3:3. Without affection, without peace, slanderers, incontinent,
unmerciful, without kindness,</p>

<p>3:4. Traitors, stubborn, puffed up, and lovers of pleasure more than of
God:</p>

<p>3:5. Having an appearance indeed of godliness but denying the power
thereof. Now these avoid.</p>

<p>3:6. For of these sort are they who creep into houses and lead captive
silly women laden with sins, who are led away with divers desires:</p>

<p>3:7. Ever learning, and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth.</p>

<p>3:8. Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the
truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>

<p>Jannes and Mambres... The magicians of king Pharao.</p>

<p>3:9. But they shall proceed no farther: for their folly shall be
manifest to all men, as theirs also was.</p>

<p>3:10. But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,
faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</p>

<p>3:11. Persecutions, afflictions: such as came upon me at Antioch, at
Iconium and at Lystra: what persecutions I endured, and out of them all
the Lord delivered me.</p>

<p>3:12. And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
persecution.</p>

<p>3:13. But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse: erring, and
driving into error,</p>

<p>3:14. But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned and
which have been committed to thee. Knowing of whom thou hast learned
them:</p>

<p>3:15. And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures
which can instruct thee to salvation by the faith which is in Christ
Jesus.</p>

<p>3:16. All scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to
reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice:</p>

<p>All scripture,... Every part of divine scripture is certainly profitable
for all these ends. But, if we would have the whole rule of Christian
faith and practice, we must not be content with those Scriptures, which
Timothy knew from his infancy, that is, with the Old Testament alone:
nor yet with the New Testament, without taking along with it the
traditions of the apostles, and the interpretation of the church, to
which the apostles delivered both the book, and the true meaning of it.</p>

<p>3:17. That the man of God may be perfect, furnished to every good work.</p>

<p>2 Timothy Chapter 4</p>

<p>His charge to Timothy. He tells him of his approaching death and desires
him to come to him.</p>

<p>4:1. I charge thee, before God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge the
living and the dead, by his coming and his kingdom:</p>

<p>4:2. Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season: reprove,
entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine.</p>

<p>4:3. For there shall be a time when they will not endure sound doctrine
but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves
teachers having itching ears:</p>

<p>4:4. And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be
turned unto fables.</p>

<p>4:5. But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an
evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. Be sober.</p>

<p>An evangelist... a diligent preacher of the gospel.</p>

<p>4:6. For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my
dissolution is at hand.</p>

<p>4:7. I have fought a good fight: I have finished my course: I have kept
the faith.</p>

<p>4:8. As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice which
the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day: and not only to
me, but to them also that love his coming. Make haste to come to me
quickly.</p>

<p>4:9. For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to
Thessalonica:</p>

<p>4:10. Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.</p>

<p>4:11. Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with thee: for he is
profitable to me for the ministry.</p>

<p>4:12. But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</p>

<p>4:13. The cloak that I left at Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest,
bring with thee: and the books, especially the parchments.</p>

<p>4:14. Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil: the Lord will
reward him according to his works:</p>

<p>4:15. Whom do thou also avoid: for he hath greatly withstood our words.</p>

<p>4:16. At my first answer, no man stood with me: but all forsook me. &nbsp;May
it not be laid to their charge!</p>

<p>4:17. But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that by me the
preaching may be accomplished and that all the Gentiles may hear. &nbsp;And I
was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>

<p>4:18. The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work and will preserve
me unto his heavenly kingdom. To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>4:19. Salute Prisca, and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>

<p>4:20. Erastus remained at Corinth. And Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.</p>

<p>4:21. Make haste to come before winter. Eubulus and Pudens and Linus and
Claudia and all the brethren, salute thee.</p>

<p>4:22. The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
Amen.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
