<p>THE PROPHECY OF NAHUM</p>

<p>NAHUM, whose name signifies A COMFORTER, was a native of Elcese, or
Elcesai, supposed to be a little town in Galilee. He prophesied, after
the ten tribes were carried into captivity, and foretold the utter
destruction of Ninive, by the Babylonians and Medes: which happened in
the reign of JOSIAS. </p>

<p>
Nahum Chapter 1</p>

<p>The majesty of God, his goodness to his people, and severity to his
enemies. </p>

<p>1:1. The burden of Ninive. The book of the vision of Nahum, the
Elcesite. </p>

<p>1:2. The Lord is a jealous God, and a revenger: the Lord is a revenger,
and hath wrath: the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he is
angry with his enemies. </p>

<p>1:3. The Lord is patient, and great in power, and will not cleanse and
acquit the guilty. The Lord's ways are in a tempest, and a whirlwind,
and clouds are the dust of his feet. </p>

<p>1:4. He rebuketh the sea and drieth it up: and bringeth all the rivers
to be a desert. Basan languisheth and Carmel: and the flower of Libanus
fadeth away. &nbsp;</p>

<p>1:5. The mountains tremble at him, and the hills are made desolate: and
the earth hath quaked at his presence, and the world, and all that dwell
therein. </p>

<p>1:6. Who can stand before the face of his indignation? and who shall
resist in the fierceness of his anger? his indignation is poured out
like fire: and the rocks are melted by him. </p>

<p>1:7. The Lord is good, and giveth strength in the day of trouble: and
knoweth them that hope in him. </p>

<p>1:8. But with a flood that passeth by, he will make an utter end of the
place thereof: and darkness shall pursue his enemies. </p>

<p>Of the place thereof... Viz., of Ninive.</p>

<p>1:9. What do ye devise against the Lord? he will make an utter end:
there shall not rise a double affliction. </p>

<p>1:10. For as thorns embrace one another: so while they are feasting and
drinking together, they shall be consumed as stubble that is fully dry. </p>

<p>1:11. Out of thee shall come forth one that imagineth evil against the
Lord, contriving treachery in his mind.</p>

<p>Shall come forth one, etc... Some understand this of Sennacherib. But as
his attempt against the people seems to have been prior to the prophecy
of Nahum, we may better understand it of Holofernes.</p>

<p>1:12. Thus saith the Lord: Though they were perfect: and many of them
so, yet thus shall they be cut off, and he shall pass: I have afflicted
thee, and I will afflict thee no more. </p>

<p>Though they were perfect, etc... That is, however strong or numerous
their forces may be, they shall be cut off; and their prince or leader
shall pass away and disappear.</p>

<p>1:13. And now I will break in pieces his rod with which he struck thy
back, and I will burst thy bonds asunder. </p>

<p>1:14. And the Lord will give a commandment concerning thee, that no more
of thy name shall be sown: I will destroy the graven and molten thing
out of the house of thy God, I will make it thy grave, for thou art
disgraced. </p>

<p>Will give a commandment... That is, a decree, concerning thee, O king of
Ninive, thy seed shall fail, etc.</p>

<p>1:15. Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
tidings, and that preacheth peace: O Juda, keep thy festivals, and pay
thy vows: for Belial shall no more pass through thee again, he is
utterly cut off. </p>

<p>Belial... The wicked one, viz., the Assyrian.</p>

<p>Nahum Chapter 2</p>

<p>God sends his armies against Ninive to destroy it. </p>

<p>2:1. He is come up that shall destroy before thy face, that shall keep
the siege: watch the way, fortify thy loins, strengthen thy power
exceedingly. </p>

<p>2:2. For the Lord hath rendered the pride of Jacob, as the pride of
Israel: because the spoilers have laid them waste, and have marred their
vine branches. </p>

<p>Hath rendered the pride of Jacob, etc... He hath punished Jacob for his
pride; and therefore Ninive must not expect to escape. Or else,
rendering the pride of Jacob means rewarding, that is, punishing Ninive
for the pride they exercised against Jacob.</p>

<p>2:3. The shield of his mighty men is like fire, the men of the army are
clad in scarlet, the reins of the chariot are flaming in the day of his
preparation, and the drivers are stupified. </p>

<p>Of his mighty men, etc... He speaks of the Chaldeans and Medes sent to
destroy Ninive.-Ibid. Stupefied... consopiti. That is, they drive on
furiously like men intoxicated with wine.</p>

<p>2:4. They are in confusion in the ways, the chariots jostle one against
another in the streets: their looks are like torches, like lightning
running to and fro. </p>

<p>2:5. He will muster up his valiant men, they shall stumble in their
march: they shall quickly get upon the walls thereof: and a covering
shall be prepared. </p>

<p>Stumble in their march... By running hastily on.</p>

<p>2:6. The gates of the rivers are opened, and the temple is thrown down
to the ground. </p>

<p>2:7. And the soldier is led away captive: and her bondwomen were led
away mourning as doves, murmuring in their hearts. </p>

<p>2:8. And as for Ninive, her waters are like a great pool: but the men
flee away. They cry: Stand, stand, but there is none that will return
back. </p>

<p>2:9. Take ye the spoil of the silver, take the spoil of the gold: for
there is no end of the riches of all the precious furniture. </p>

<p>2:10. She is destroyed, and rent, and torn: the heart melteth, and the
knees fail, and all the loins lose their strength: and the faces of them
all are as the blackness of a kettle. </p>

<p>2:11. Where is now the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of
the young lions, to which the lion went, to enter in thither, the young
lion, and there was none to make them afraid? </p>

<p>2:12. The lion caught enough for his whelps, and killed for his
lionesses: and he filled his holes with prey, and his den with rapine. </p>

<p>2:13. Behold I come against thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will
burn thy chariots even to smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young
lions: and I will cut off thy prey out of the land, and the voice of thy
messengers shall be heard no more. </p>

<p>Nahum Chapter 3</p>

<p>The miserable destruction of Ninive. </p>

<p>3:1. Woe to thee, 0 city of blood, all full of lies and violence: rapine
shall not depart from thee. </p>

<p>3:2. The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels,
and of the neighing horse; and of the running chariot, and of the
horsemen coming up,</p>

<p>3:3. And of the shining sword, and of the glittering spear, and of a
multitude slain, and of a grievous destruction: and there is no end of
carcasses, and they shall fall down on their dead bodies. </p>

<p>3:4. Because of the multitude of the fornications of the harlot that was
beautiful and agreeable, and that made use of witchcraft, that sold
nations through her fornications, and families through her witchcrafts. </p>

<p>3:5. Behold I come against thee, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will
discover thy shame to thy face, and will shew thy nakedness to the
nations, and thy shame to kingdoms. </p>

<p>3:6. And I will cast abominations upon thee, and will disgrace thee, and
will make an example of thee. </p>

<p>3:7. And it shall come to pass that every one that shall see thee, shall
flee from thee, and shall say: Ninive is laid waste: who shall bemoan
thee? whence shall I seek a comforter for thee? </p>

<p>3:8. Art thou better than the populous Alexandria, that dwelleth among
the rivers? waters are round about it: the sea is its riches: the waters
are its walls. </p>

<p>Populous Alexandria... No-Ammon. A populous city of Egypt destroyed by
the Chaldeans, and afterwards rebuilt by Alexander, and called
Alexandria. Others suppose No-Ammon to be the same as Diospolis.</p>

<p>3:9. Ethiopia and Egypt were the strength thereof, and there is no end:
Africa and the Libyans were thy helpers. </p>

<p>3:10. Yet she also was removed and carried into cap-tivity: her young
children were dashed in pieces at the top of every street, and they cast
lots upon her nobles, and all her great men were bound in fetters. </p>

<p>3:11. Therefore thou also shalt be made drunk, and shalt be despised:
and thou shalt seek help from the enemies. </p>

<p>3:12. All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with their green
figs: if they be shaken, they shall fall into the mouth of the eater. </p>

<p>3:13. Behold thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of thy
land shall be set wide open to thy enemies, the fire shall devour thy
bars. </p>

<p>3:14. Draw thee water for the siege, build up thy bulwarks: go into the
clay, and tread, work it and make brick.</p>

<p>3:15. There shall the fire devour thee: thou shalt perish by the sword,
it shall devour thee like the bruchus: assemble together like the
bruchus, make thyself many like the locust. </p>

<p>3:16. Thou hast multiplied thy merchandises above the stars of heaven:
the bruchus hath spread himself and flown away. </p>

<p>3:17. Thy guards are like the locusts: and thy little ones like the
locusts of locusts which swarm on the hedges in the day of cold: the sun
arose, and they flew away, and their place was not known where they
were. </p>

<p>Locusts of locusts... The young locusts.</p>

<p>3:18. Thy shepherds have slumbered, O king of Assyria, thy princes shall
be buried: thy people are hid in the mountains, and there is none to
gather them. </p>

<p>3:19. Thy destruction is not hidden, thy wound is grievous: all that
have heard the fame of thee, have clapped their hands over thee: for
upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually? </p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
