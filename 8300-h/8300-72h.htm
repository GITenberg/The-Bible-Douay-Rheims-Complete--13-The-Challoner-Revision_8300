<p>THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JUDE</p>

<p>St. Jude, who wrote this Epistle, was one of the twelve Apostles and
brother to St. James the Less. The time it was written is uncertain:
only it may be inferred from verse 17 that few or none of the Apostles
were then living, except St. John. He inveighs against the heresies and
wicked practices of the Simonians, Nicolaites, and Gnostics, etc.,
describing them and their leaders by strong epithets and similes, He
exhorts the faithful to contend earnestly for the faith first delivered
to them and to beware of heretics.</p>

<p>
Jude Chapter 1</p>

<p>He exhorts them to stand to the faith first delivered to them and to
beware of heretics.</p>

<p>1:1. Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James: to them
that are beloved in God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ and
called.</p>

<p>1:2. Mercy unto you and peace: and charity be fulfilled.</p>

<p>1:3. Dearly beloved, taking all care to write unto you concerning your
common salvation, I was under a necessity to write unto you: to beseech
you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.</p>

<p>1:4. For certain men are secretly entered in (who were written of long
ago unto this judgment), ungodly men, turning the grace of our Lord God
into riotousness and denying the only sovereign Ruler and our Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>1:5. I will therefore admonish you, though ye once knew all things, that
Jesus, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, did afterwards
destroy them that believed not.</p>

<p>1:6. And the angels who kept not their principality but forsook their
own habitation, he hath reserved under darkness in everlasting chains,
unto the judgment of the great day.</p>

<p>Principality... That is, the state in which they were first created,
their original dignity.</p>

<p>1:7. As Sodom and Gomorrha and the neighbouring cities, in like manner,
having given themselves to fornication and going after other flesh, were
made an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.</p>

<p>1:8. In like manner, these men also defile the flesh and despise
dominion and blaspheme majesty.</p>

<p>Blaspheme majesty... Speak evil of them that are in dignity; and even
utter blasphemies against the divine majesty.</p>

<p>1:9. When Michael the archangel, disputing with the devil, contended
about the body of Moses, he durst not bring against him the judgment of
railing speech, but said: The Lord command thee.</p>

<p>Contended about the body, etc... This contention, which is no where else
mentioned in holy writ, was originally known by revelation, and
transmitted by tradition. It is thought the occasion of it was, that the
devil would have had the body buried in such a place and manner, as to
be worshipped by the Jews with divine honours. Command thee... or rebuke
thee.</p>

<p>1:10. But these men blaspheme whatever things they know not: and what
things soever they naturally know, like dumb beasts, in these they are
corrupted.</p>

<p>1:11. Woe unto them! For they have gone in the way of Cain: and after
the error of Balaam they have for reward poured out themselves and have
perished in the contradiction of Core.</p>

<p>Gone in the way, etc... Heretics follow the way of Cain, by murdering
the souls of their brethren; the way of Balaam, by putting a scantal
before the people of God, for their own private ends; and the way of
Core or Korah, by their opposition to the church governors of divine
appointment.</p>

<p>1:12. These are spots in their banquets, feasting together without fear,
feeding themselves: clouds without water, which are carried about by
winds: trees of the autumn, unfruitful, twice dead, plucked up by the
roots:</p>

<p>1:13. Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own confusion:
wandering stars, to whom the storm of darkness is reserved for ever.</p>

<p>1:14. Now of these Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied,
saying: Behold, the Lord cometh with thousands of his saints:</p>

<p>Prophesied... This prophecy was either known by tradition, or from some
book that is since lost.</p>

<p>1:15. To execute judgment upon all and to reprove all the ungodly for
all the works of their ungodliness, whereby they have done ungodly: and
for all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against God.</p>

<p>1:16. These are murmurers, full of complaints, walking according to
their own desires: and their mouth speaketh proud things, admiring
persons, for gain's sake.</p>

<p>1:17. But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful of the words which have
been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful, etc... He now exhorts the
faithful to remain steadfast in the belief and practice of what they had
heard from the apostles, who had also foretold that in aftertimes (lit.
in the last time) there should be false teachers, scoffing and
ridiculing all revealed truths, abandoning themselves to their passions
and lusts; who separate themselves from the Catholic communion by
heresies and schisms. Sensual men... carried away and enslaved by the
pleasures of the senses.</p>

<p>1:18. Who told you that in the last time there should come mockers,
walking according to their own desires in ungodlinesses.</p>

<p>1:19. These are they who separate themselves, sensual men, having not
the Spirit.</p>

<p>1:20. But you, my beloved, building yourselves upon your most holy
faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</p>

<p>1:21. Keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our
Lord Jesus Christ, unto life everlasting.</p>

<p>Building yourselves upon your most holy faith... Raising by your
actions, a spiritual building, founded, 1st, upon faith; 2d, on the love
of God; 3d, upon hope, whilst you are waiting for the mercies of God,
and the reward of eternal life; 4th, joined with the great duty of
prayer.</p>

<p>1:22. And some indeed reprove, being judged:</p>

<p>1:23. But others save, pulling them out of the fire. And on others have
mercy, in fear, hating also the spotted garment which is carnal.</p>

<p>And some indeed repove being judged... He gives them another instruction
to practice charity in endeavouring to convert their neighbour, where
they will meet with three sorts of persons: 1st, With persons obstinate
in their errors and sins; these may be said to be already judged and
condemned; they are to be sharply reprehended, reproved, and if possible
convinced of their error. 2d, As to others you must endeavour to save
them, by pulling them, as it were, out of the fire, from the ruin they
stand in great danger of. 3d, You must have mercy on others in fear,
when you see them through ignorance of frailty, in danger of being drawn
into the snares of these heretics; with these you must deal more gently
and mildly, with a charitable compassion, hating always, and teaching
others to hate the carnal garment which is spotted, their sensual and
corrupt manners, that defile both the soul and body.</p>

<p>1:24. Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to present
you spotless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, in the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>1:25. To the only God our Saviour through Jesus Christ our Lord, be
glory and magnificence, empire and power, before all ages, and now, and
for all ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p>Now to him, etc... St. Jude concludes his epistle with this doxology of
praising God, and praying to the only God our Saviour, which may either
signify God the Father, or God as equally agreeing to all the three
persons, who are equally the cause of Christ's incarnation, and man's
salvation, through Jesus Christ our Lord, who, being God from eternity,
took upon him our human nature, that he might become our Redeemer.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL</a>
