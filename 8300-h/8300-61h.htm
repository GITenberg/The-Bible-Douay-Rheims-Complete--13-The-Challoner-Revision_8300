<h1>Book 61 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Timothy</h1>





<p>THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY</p>

<p>St. Paul write this Epistle to his BELOVED TIMOTHY, being then bishop of
Ephesus, to instruct him in the duties of a bishop, both in respect to
himself and to his charge; and that he ought to be well informed of the
good morals of those on whom he was to impose hands: Impose not hands
lightly upon any man. He tells him also how he should behave towards his
clergy. The Epistle was written about 33 years after our Lord's
Ascension; but where it was written is uncertain: the more general
opinion is, that it was in Macedonia.</p>

<p>
1 Timothy Chapter 1</p>

<p>He puts Timothy in mind of his charge and blesses God for the mercy he
himself had received.</p>

<p>1:1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the commandment of
God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope:</p>

<p>1:2. To Timothy, his beloved son in faith. Grace, mercy and peace, from
God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<p>1:3. As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia,
that thou mightest charge some not to teach otherwise:</p>

<p>1:4. Not to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which furnish
questions rather than the edification of God which is in faith.</p>

<p>1:5. Now the end of the commandment is charity from a pure heart, and a
good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.</p>

<p>1:6. From which things some, going astray, are turned aside unto vain
babbling:</p>

<p>1:7. Desiring to be teachers of the law: understanding neither the
things they say, nor whereof they affirm.</p>

<p>1:8. But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully.</p>

<p>1:9. Knowing this: That the law is not made for the just man but for the
unjust and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the wicked
and defiled, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for
manslayers,</p>

<p>The law is not... He means, that the just man doth good, and avoideth
evil, not as compelled by the law, and merely for fear of the punishment
appointed for transgressors; but voluntarily, and out of the love of God
and virtue; and would do so, though there were no law.</p>

<p>1:10. For fornicators, for them who defile themselves with mankind, for
menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and whatever other thing
is contrary to sound doctrine:</p>

<p>1:11. Which is according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God
which hath been committed to my trust.</p>

<p>1:12. I give him thanks who hath strengthened me, even to Christ Jesus
our Lord, for that he hath counted me faithful, putting me in the
ministry:</p>

<p>1:13. Who before was a blasphemer and a persecutor and contumelious. But
I obtained the mercy of God, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</p>

<p>1:14. Now the grace of our Lord hath abounded exceedingly with faith and
love, which is in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>1:15. A faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief.</p>

<p>1:16. But for this cause have I obtained mercy: that in me first Christ
Jesus might shew forth all patience, for the information of them that
shall believe in him unto life everlasting.</p>

<p>1:17. Now to the king of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be
honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>1:18. This precept, I commend to thee, O son Timothy: according to the
prophecies going before on thee, that thou war in them a good warfare,</p>

<p>1:19. Having faith and a good conscience, which some rejecting have made
shipwreck concerning the faith.</p>

<p>1:20. Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered up to
Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</p>

<p>1 Timothy Chapter 2</p>

<p>Prayers are to be said for all men, because God wills the salvation of
all. Women are not to teach.</p>

<p>2:1. I desire therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers,
intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men:</p>

<p>2:2. For kings and for all that are in high station: that we may lead a
quiet and a peaceable life in all piety and chastity.</p>

<p>2:3. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,</p>

<p>2:4. Who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of
the truth.</p>

<p>2:5. For there is one God: and one mediator of God and men, the man
Christ Jesus:</p>

<p>One mediator... Christ is the one and only mediator of redemption, who
gave himself, as the apostle writes in the following verse.</p>

<p>2:6. Who gave himself a redemption for all, a testimony in due times,
a redemption for all.... He is also the only mediator, who stands in
need of no other to recommend his petitions to the Father. But this is
not against our seeking the prayers and intercession, as well of the
faithful upon earth, as of the saints and angels in heaven, for
obtaining mercy, grace, and salvation, through Jesus Christ. As St. Paul
himself often desired the help of the prayers of the faithful, without
any injury to the mediatorship of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>2:7. Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle (I say the
truth, I lie not), a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</p>

<p>2:8. I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up pure
hands, without anger and contention.</p>

<p>2:9. In like manner, women also in decent apparel: adorning themselves
with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or
costly attire:</p>

<p>2:10. But, as it becometh women professing godliness, with good works.</p>

<p>2:11. Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</p>

<p>2:12. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to use authority over the
man: but to be in silence.</p>

<p>2:13. For Adam was first formed; then Eve.</p>

<p>2:14. And Adam was not seduced; but the woman, being seduced, was in the
transgression.</p>

<p>2:15. Yet she shall be saved through child bearing; if she continue in
faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.</p>

<p>1 Timothy Chapter 3</p>

<p>What sort of men are to be admitted into the clergy. The church is the
pillar of truth.</p>

<p>3:1. A faithful saying: If a man desire the office of a bishop, he
desireth good work.</p>

<p>3:2. It behoveth therefore a bishop to be blameless, the husband of one
wife, sober, prudent, of good behaviour, chaste, given to hospitality, a
teacher,</p>

<p>Of one wife.... The meaning is not that every bishop should have a wife
(for St. Paul himself had none), but that no one should be admitted to
the holy orders of bishop, priest, or deacon, who had been married more
than once.</p>

<p>3:3. Not given to wine, no striker, but modest, not quarrelsome, not
covetous, but</p>

<p>3:4. One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in
subjection with all chastity.</p>

<p>3:5. But if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take
care of the church of God?</p>

<p>3:6. Not a neophyte: lest, being puffed up with pride, he fall into the
judgment of the devil.</p>

<p>A neophyte.... That is, one lately baptized, a young convert.</p>

<p>3:7. Moreover, he must have a good testimony of them who are without:
lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</p>

<p>3:8. Deacons in like manner: chaste, not double tongued, not given to
much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre:</p>

<p>3:9. Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience.</p>

<p>3:10. And let these also first be proved: and so let them minister,
having no crime.</p>

<p>3:11. The women in like manner: chaste, not slanderers, but sober,
faithful in all things.</p>

<p>3:12. Let deacons be the husbands of one wife: who rule well their
children and their own houses.</p>

<p>3:13. For they that have ministered well shall purchase to themselves a
good degree and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>3:14. These things I write to thee, hoping that I shall come to thee
shortly.</p>

<p>3:15. But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living
God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</p>

<p>The pillar and ground of the truth.... Therefore the church of the
living God can never uphold error, nor bring in corruptions,
superstition, or idolatry.</p>

<p>3:16. And evidently great is the mystery of godliness, which was
manifested in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, appeared unto
angels, hath been preached unto the Gentiles, is believed in the world,
is taken up in glory.</p>

<p>1 Timothy Chapter 4</p>

<p>He warns him against heretics, and exhorts him to the exercise of piety.</p>

<p>4:1. Now the Spirit manifestly saith that in the last times some shall
depart from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error and doctrines of
devils,</p>

<p>4:2. Speaking lies in hypocrisy and having their conscience seared,</p>

<p>4:3. Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats, which God hath created
to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful and by them that have
known the truth.</p>

<p>Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats.... He speaks of the
Gnostics, the Marcionites, the Eneratites, the Manicheans, and other
ancient heretics, who absolutely condemned marriage, and the use of all
kind of meat; because they pretended that all flesh was from an evil
principle. Whereas the church of God, so far from condemning marriage,
holds it a holy sacrament; and forbids it to none but such as by vow
have chosen the better part: and prohibits not the use of any meats
whatsoever in proper times and seasons; though she does not judge all
kind of diet proper for days of fasting and penance.</p>

<p>4:4. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected that
is received with thanksgiving:</p>

<p>4:5. For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>

<p>4:6. These things proposing to the brethren, thou shalt be a good
minister of Christ Jesus, nourished up in the words of faith and of the
good doctrine which thou hast attained unto.</p>

<p>4:7. But avoid foolish and old wives fables: and exercise thyself unto
godliness.</p>

<p>4:8. For bodily exercise is profitable to little: but godliness is
profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is and of
that which is to come.</p>

<p>4:9. A faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</p>

<p>4:10. For therefore we labour and are reviled, because we hope in the
living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.</p>

<p>4:11. These things command and teach:</p>

<p>4:12. Let no man despise thy youth: but be thou an example of the
faithful, in word, in conversation, in charity, in faith, in chastity.</p>

<p>4:13. Till I come, attend unto reading, to exhortation and to doctrine.</p>

<p>4:14. Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was given thee by
prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the priesthood.</p>

<p>4:15. Meditate upon these things, be wholly in these things: that thy
profiting may be manifest to all.</p>

<p>4:16. Take heed to thyself and to doctrine: be earnest in them. &nbsp;For in
doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee.</p>

<p>1 Timothy Chapter 5</p>

<p>He gives him lessons concerning widows, and how he is to behave to his
clergy.</p>

<p>5:1. An ancient man rebuke not, but entreat him as a father: young men,
as brethren:</p>

<p>5:2. Old women, as mothers: young women, as sisters, in all chastity.</p>

<p>5:3. Honour widows that are widows indeed.</p>

<p>5:4. But if any widow have children or grandchildren, let her learn
first to govern her own house and to make a return of duty to her
parents; for this is acceptable before God.</p>

<p>5:5. But she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, let her trust in God
and continue in supplications and prayers night and day.</p>

<p>5:6. For she that liveth in pleasures is dead while she is living.</p>

<p>5:7. And this give in charge, that they may be blameless.</p>

<p>5:8. But if any man have not care of his own and especially of those of
his house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.</p>

<p>5:9. Let a widow be chosen of no less than threescore years of age, who
hath been the wife of one husband.</p>

<p>5:11. But the younger widows avoid. For when they have grown wanton in
Christ, they will marry:</p>

<p>5:12. Having damnation, because they have made void their first faith.</p>

<p>Their first faith.... Their vow, by which they had engaged themselves to
Christ.</p>

<p>5:13. And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house:
and are not only idle, but tattlers also and busy bodies, speaking
things which they ought not.</p>

<p>5:14. I will, therefore, that the younger should marry, bear children,
be mistresses of families, give no occasion to the adversary to speak
evil.</p>

<p>5:15. For some are already turned aside after Satan.</p>

<p>5:16. If any of the faithful have widows, let him minister to them, and
let not the church be charged: that there may be sufficient for them
that are widows indeed.</p>

<p>5:17. Let the priests that rule well be esteemed worthy of double
honour: especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</p>

<p>5:18. For the scripture saith: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward.</p>

<p>5:19. Against a priest receive not an accusation, but under two or three
witnesses.</p>

<p>5:20. Them that sin reprove before all that the rest also may have fear.</p>

<p>5:21. I charge thee, before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels,
that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by
declining to either side.</p>

<p>5:22. Impose not hands lightly upon any man, neither be partaker of
other men's sins. Keep thyself chaste.</p>

<p>5:23. Do not still drink water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's
sake and thy frequent infirmities.</p>

<p>5:24. Some men's sins are manifest, going before to judgment: and some
men they follow after.</p>

<p>5:25. In like manner also good deeds are manifest: and they that are
otherwise cannot be hid.</p>

<p>1 Timothy Chapter 6</p>

<p>Duties of servants. The danger of covetousness. Lessons for the rich.</p>

<p>6:1. Whosoever are servants under the yoke, let them count their masters
worthy of all honour; lest the name of the Lord and his doctrine be
blasphemed.</p>

<p>6:2. But they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,
because they are brethren; but serve them the rather, because they are
faithful and beloved, who are partakers of the benefit. These things
teach and exhort.</p>

<p>6:3. If any man teach otherwise and consent not to the sound words of
our Lord Jesus Christ and to that doctrine which is according to
godliness,</p>

<p>6:4. He is proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and strifes
of words; from which arise envies, contentions, blasphemies, evil
suspicions,</p>

<p>6:5. Conflicts of men corrupted in mind and who are destitute of the
truth, supposing gain to be godliness.</p>

<p>6:6. But godliness with contentment is great gain.</p>

<p>6:7. For we brought nothing into this world: and certainly we can carry
nothing out.</p>

<p>6:8. But having food and wherewith to be covered, with these we are
content.</p>

<p>6:9. For they that will become rich fall into temptation and into the
snare of the devil and into many unprofitable and hurtful desires, which
drown men into destruction and perdition.</p>

<p>6:10. For the desire of money is the root of all evils; which some
coveting have erred from the faith and have entangled themselves in many
sorrows.</p>

<p>6:11. But thou, O man of God, fly these things: and pursue justice,
godliness, faith, charity, patience, mildness.</p>

<p>6:12. Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life, whereunto
thou art called and be it confessed a good confession before many
witnesses.</p>

<p>6:13. I charge thee before God who quickeneth all things, and before
Christ Jesus who gave testimony under Pontius Pilate, a good confession:</p>

<p>6:14. That thou keep the commandment without spot, blameless, unto the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

<p>6:15. Which in his times he shall shew, who is the Blessed and only
Mighty, the King of kings and Lord of lords:</p>

<p>6:16. Who only hath immortality and inhabiteth light inaccessible: whom
no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and empire everlasting.
Amen.</p>

<p>6:17. Charge the rich of this world not to be highminded nor to trust in
the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God (who giveth us
abundantly all things to enjoy)</p>

<p>6:18. To do good, to be rich in good work, to give easily, to
communicate to others,</p>

<p>6:19. To lay up in store for themselves a good foundation against the
time to come, that they may lay hold on the true life.</p>

<p>6:20. O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding the
profane novelties of words and oppositions of knowledge falsely so
called.</p>

<p>6:21. Which some promising, have erred concerning the faith. Grace be
with thee. Amen.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
